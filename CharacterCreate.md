## The Section Detailing the Basic Overview of Your Character

Your character is defined by three interconnected parts: their personality, their background, and their skills. None of these parts can be created in a vacuum, so it is impossible to generate a character without a context; both their party and the wider world.

### Personality

Your character’s personality includes the key features that identify and define them and are informed by the setting and your character’s background.

**Names** are key identifiers that also give us a place in society. Names are almost always given by others, and most cultures have important naming conventions that help situate you in your social groups.

**Physical Appearance** includes both anatomical data such as hair colour and cultural expressions such as hair style, both of which are often equally important.

**Auditory Cues** are used to facilitate role-play, make your character more memorable, and develop their upbringing and attitudes.

**Link to the Party** is a feature of all characters, including Player-Characters. It can include relationships, genealogy, social groupings, or simply commonalities that make you click with the party.

**Downtime Activities** help fill out your character and connect them to their skills, background and wider world. It’s also what you’re doing when you are caught unawares.

**Fate** is simultaneously how your character will exit the game, and also how they will level-up. How many times can you challenge your fate before it refuses to bend? Fate is usually presented as a mortal statement such as “I will die in a boxing match.”

### Background

Extensive, unique backgrounds are offered as setting-specific additions to published modules. They include suggestions on personality traits common to the background such as naming conventions of a certain society. They also include unique abilities granted only to those with the background, and access to additional abilities that can be learned or honed over your adventuring career regardless of their arena of play. These background abilities can, for example, give a fighter access to a spell or magical ability, or give a ranger access to an artistic talent or additional language. A starting background is found in the Appendix.

### Skills

Your character has 2 skills, which are deep, unique sets of proficiencies, abilities and context that drive the mechanics, personality and development of your character. Each skill belongs to one of the 4 Arenas of Play; martial, magic, factions or recon. You can choose two skills from the same arena. The skills themselves include starting proficiencies and abilities that are wide-ranging. There can be no exhaustive list of either skills or proficiencies, and overlaps and gaps are common. Skills often feature unique abilities found nowhere else in the game, but also make recommendations about more generic abilities within their arena of play. A selection of starting skills are found in the Appendix.

### Other Attributes

**Proficiencies** are defined by your background and skills. They are the things to which you can apply your proficiency bonus, and they are not bound by exhaustive lists or limitations on their definitions. You can be proficient in the use of all knives, or in understanding bird communications, or in navigating through forest terrain, or in navigating as long as you can see the moon. Each proficiency is a rule unto itself.  
**Bonuses**, whether skill, save, or proficiency are simply equal to your level. If you are level 4, your bonus is always \+4.  
**Passive Skill** is the ability you have to take on an action you are proficient with when you are not actively doing so, for example to walk over ice while you are actively scanning the horizon for danger, or to be aware of danger while you actively plod your way across the ice. It is always 5 \+ your proficiency bonus.  
**Energy** is used to buff your roll (take the higher dice), or to activate abilities. Because it’s used to buff your rolls and because you roll saves and active defenses, having no energy leaves you defenseless and more likely to suffer harm. When your energy is 0, you should flee. You can regenerate to half your energy by resting for an hour or completely regenerate it by resting for 8 hours.  
**Social Credit** is used like energy for faction interactions, buffing rolls and activating abilities.  
**Leveling Points** represent the limits on what your fate opens up to your character when they successfully challenge it. You get 2 when you level up (in addition to adding \+1 to your bonuses). You can use one levelling point to add a new ability from your background or skills, or to add a new proficiency, or to increase your max energy or max Social Credit by 1\.
