# Glossary

**Ability \[Play|Spell|Asset|Strategy\]**  
Abilities are discrete actions a creature can perform, sometimes with an associated energy, supply or social credit cost that have a mechanical effect.  
Natural Abilities are abilities that are granted by virtue of a creature's basic nature and physical characteristics.  
Background Abilities are abilities that are granted by virtue of a character’s background.  
Each Arena of Play uses a particular word to describe its abilities, however they are functionally identical within the idicyncracies of their arena of play. Plays are Martial Abilities, Spells are Magic Abilities, Assets are Faction Abilities and Strategies are Recon Abilities.

**Arena of Play**  
A mode of understanding actions in a mechanical context as being either martial, magical, faction or recon based.

**Breakthrough**  
A result that is more than 5 points above the difficulty, indicating an unqualified success or major shift in outcomes as dictated by the narrative.

**Buff \[Debuff\]**  
Take the higher of the two dice rolled. You can do this by expending energy for physical and magical actions, social credit for faction actions, and various other methods found elsewhere. Having multiple reasons to be buffed has no effect.  
Debuff is to prevent the higher die from being taken. Debuffs always overcome any number of buffs, so if there are 3 reasons a creature is buffed and only one reason it is debuffed, it takes the lower die.

**Challenge \[Fate Challenge\]**

A challenge is a series of checks set out to accomplish a narrative goal that has both a success and fail state, and uncertainty of either.

A fate challenge, usually the culmination of a series of other challenges, is a challenge that a player would like to use to challenge their character’s fate. The success state is tied to the character levelling up, and the fail state indicates that the character is permanently retired or dies.

**Character**  
A Character is a Humanoid with a Personality.

**Check \[Skill Check | Save\]**  
A check is a roll to test the consequences of an action. If the result of failure would impose a condition on the one executing the action, it is called a save.

**Conditions \[Minor and Critical\]**  
Conditions are afflictions that alter how a character can access their abilities, skills, proficiencies, buffs and other features.  
Minor conditions can reduce access to or effectiveness of some skills and abilities. Critical conditions reduce the character to a barely playable state.  
Unless otherwise stated, conditions can be relieved over the course of a long rest.Temporary conditions end at the end of a challenge. Permanent conditions cannot be overcome in a long rest and require a narrative solution (quest).

**Consequence**  
The narrative effect that takes place because of a check or save, which often has a mechanical component as well.

**Creature**  
A creature is an object, composite or swarm with an intrinsic ability to act upon the world.

**Damage**  
The number result of a check or save where the consequence is the application of a condition.

**Difficulty \[Base\]**  
The defense number for a check against an inanimate object, geography, etc. The difficulty operates identically to the passive defense of a creature in that a check is compared against it to determine a consequence of an action.  
Base Difficulty of a region, faction or locale is the assumed difficulty to take any unsure action regarding that geography or polity, for example to cross a river or find a market.  
The GM never arbitrates difficulties, they are based on the base difficulty, a stated creature’s passive skills, or on the party level \+5.

**Encounter**  
The meeting of two or more parties in a locale where they can sense eachother and interact meaningfully. Often intentionally contrived narratively or through an initiative check.

**Energy \[Max\]**  
The stored biochemical energy you can exert to undertake exceptional actions, including buffing actions, casting spells and using martial plays.  
A human’s max energy starts at 2 and can be increased by 1 by using a levelling point, representing increased overall fitness and efficiency at their usual actions.

**Ethereal**   
Anything without substantive physical form, such as smoke, mist, or arcane ether. Ethereal things have a location in the physical world, but they can share their space with any number of other ethereal things or any number of physical things that also fit in that space. They can move through most materials except iron, lead and certain other materials you designate for your setting, though most materials would be considered difficult terrain. Only those materials they cannot cross can be used to physically harm ethereal creatures or objects. Ethereal things are not necessarily invisible, nor are they necessarily visible. Their default visibility depends on the nature of their etherealness. Ethereal creatures cannot be tracked using terrain type, since they do not interact with terrain very much. They can still be tracked using their creature type or locality. Ethereal creatures cannot interact with physical objects, including iron or lead.

**Graduated Check**  
The repetition of a nearly identical check, which therefore takes place over the next higher time scale. For example, a check to open a door as an action can be re-taken using identical methods, characters and tools, but it will then be taken as a minute-long check. It could again be re-taken but as a ten-minute long check, etc.

**Humanoid**  
A Creature that is capable of communicating and understanding communication, forming and understanding complex social bonds, and therefore acting in and being subject to the factions arena of play. The exact definition can be elusive, but you could consider whether or not a creature would be reasonably capable of articulating the Prisoners’ Dilemma as a benchmark. Not all creatures that can communicate are humanoids. It does not refer to their silhouette or physical characteristics in any way.

**Locale**  
An area, usually less than 300m to a side, that represents a discrete tactical unit. It cannot easily be entered or exited or circumvented, has defined edges and an identity such as “the bowling alley” or “around the pond”. It can therefore be targeted by checks such as initiative, investigations and some spells, and it is the unit by which initiative usually sets up and tactical challenges are undertaken.

**Points \[Intel | Initiative\]**  
The numeric result of an intel or initiative check, usually used to establish the number of data points or preparatory actions available as a consequence of each check respectively.

**Proficiency \[Bonus\]**  
The knowledge of how to do something and practice of being able to do it, expressed mechanically by adding your proficiency bonus (equal to your level) to a roll to come out with a result.

**Rest \[Short|Long\]**  
A period in which a character engages in physical and mental recovery, often reclining, relaxing, eating, sleeping, socializing and engaging in their downtime activity. In order to rest, a creature must be in an environment that they can naturally survive indefinitely, including an appropriate temperature and moisture, the ability to change positions, etc.  
A short rest takes one hour and consumes one ration, and allows the creature to recover energy up to half its maximum energy, so if its maximum is 6, it can only regain energy to come up to 3\.  
A long rest takes 8 hours, and requires the creature to consume one ration and have access to water for washing and drinking, and for the creature to fall asleep. At the end of a long rest, a creature restores all its energy and social credit, and can either eliminate a minor condition or reduce a critical condition to its minor form.

**Result**  
The Result of a check or roll is the numerical value of the chosen die plus proficiency. For example, if you roll 2 and 7 and have a proficiency of \+6, your result is 8 unless you buff the roll, in which case it is 15\.

**Roll**  
The numbers that appear on the dice when they are rolled such as 8-11 or 2-7.

**Sense \[Primary\]**  
The ability that a creature uses to perceive the world. All creatures have a primary sense, which is specifically defined if it is not equivalent to human vision. The primary use of a sense is to designate targets, so a creature must be obscured from its opponents primary sense to avoid being targeted. A creature can use non-primary senses to try to designate targets, but does so within the limits of that sense and without proficiency.

**Social Credit \[Max\]**  
Some combination of your charisma, wealth, family background, fame, and the myriad other things that guide peoples’ perception of you and your ability to get people to do what you want.  
Humans start with 1 max social credit and can add additional social credit by using  levelling points, representing their increased fame, wealth, knowledge, or skill in social circles.

**Supply**  
Stuff you have. It remains undefined until such a time as you need to use it for something, at which time it takes on a form that is narratively plausible based on your surroundings, character, skills, packs or other narrative reasoning.

**Target**  
Many abilities, especially spells, require you to target a creature, object or location. You must be able to sense targets using your creature’s natural primary sense. For most characters this means you must be able to see them. Creatures that are hidden are presumed to be hidden from this sense, no matter what it is, meaning they cannot be targeted.  
Humans’ primary sense is sight, but we also have considerable spatial sense. For that reason, humans can target such creatures as “the creature beneath the blanket” or “the figure in the dark,” even if their exact nature is obscured, we can see enough of them to put their body together spatially. In total darkness, humans cannot target creatures even if they can feel or hear them. As long as you can use your primary sense to sense them, you can target them. This means humans can target through mirrors or remote viewing. Other creatures such as dogs would use their own primary sense, smell, to the same effect. If you are aware of the primary sense of a creature, you can make an ordinary encounter check to hide from their primary sense and prevent them from targeting you.

**Time \[Tactical | Strategic\]**  
Tactical time takes place in discrete rounds, with each opposing side taking one turn each round to undertake their tactical maneuvers and actions. Overall, tactical challenges usually take less than one minute, with each round representing a few seconds. Tactical challenges usually address tactically relevant uncertainties, for example rushing to get onto a train that is currently departing. Generally, martial actions are tactical (take a few seconds) unless otherwise stated or narratively obvious.  
Strategic time takes longer. The intervals are one hour, in which time all parties simultaneously conduct their strategic actions. If there is an uncertainty when it comes to which such actions take place first, the answer is usually resolved tactically. For example, if two parties are trying to get to a nearby town, a tactical challenge to board the train may determine which party arrives minutes before the other. Generally, Faction and Recon checks are strategic (take one hour) unless otherwise stated or narratively obvious.
