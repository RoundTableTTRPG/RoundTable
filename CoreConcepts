# Chapter 1 : Core Concepts and Introductory Information {#chapter-1-:-core-concepts-and-introductory-information}

Round Table is a folk-fantasy RPG about parties of ordinary people who must forge their fate in a world much grander than themselves. It takes place among isolated regions of diverse and vibrant cultures trying to eke out an existence in an unforgiving universe that does not yield to human endeavor.

**Folk Fantasy** is about the ordinary people that make up the world. World building is focused on small communities and cultures. Character generation is about a character’s place in a larger society. Play relies on cooperation with the non-player world to overcome dangers that no hero can face.

**Folk Magic** is accessible, practical, and part of everyday life. It is so ordinary, in fact, that its very existence should sometimes come into question. Spells to conceal things hidden from sight, to know things commonly known, to speak languages people often speak, to heal ailments that are commonly healed; these are the practical applications of folk magic in Round table. They equally beg the question of why one would practice magic when they could learn the corresponding skill instead, but also why learn the skill when magic will do the trick. Magic seeks only to smudge the line between the mundane and arcane.

Your character is **Not Exceptional**. They have a specialty represented by their primary skills, but play is about local people doing local things, and your character and your party are local people doing local things. You do have skills and a willingness to adventure that positions you as the type of person that other folk might ask to do… unusual things.

**The Gods are Small Rocks**, much to the terror of the average person.There is no over-arching group of all-powerful beings dictating things from a mountaintop in Round Table. The people are left in a world of fairies and dragons and jinn to fend for themselves. The divines, a group of beings characterized for their immortality and extra-planar origins, are just one of many equally threatening and powerful creature types, and there is no reason to consider them supreme over any of the others. In fact, they are a preferred snack of the dragons.

**Each level is a mortal struggle** and the odds are not in your favor, but the stories are about the lives of ordinary people, and that’s a reality we all face together. The beginning and end of a character’s story should not be defined by levels 1 and 15\. Your table will define and decide on the story at hand, but dying or retiring will typically be your character’s outro.

**There is no central system of price fixing** or guaranteed availability of any particular items in any particular place. The abilities to buy land, start a business, travel overland, buy or sell goods, associate with certain people, or even possess certain items are neither commonplace nor consistent. From swords to spells to accommodations, sometimes you can buy them at market, sometimes you can’t even own them. Wealth represents your position in society, not the other way around. The top 1% will always have credit available to them, a peasant’s gold is worthless in the face of taxes, regulations and plain old thieves.

### 4 Arenas of Play

There are four Arenas of Play in Round Table that represent four modalities through which one can understand the world and game, and the actions that may be taken as well. Each character and most creatures are proficient in two arenas, meaning they are left vulnerable to the others without support from friends and allies.

#### ![][image1]Martial

Leaping, sliding and smashing their way their way through split-second challenges that are pivotal turning points, creatures that dominate the martial arena use specialized plays, weapons and other equipment to overcome adversity through acrobatics, dexterity or brute force.

#### ![][image2]Factions

Conniving, Investigating, convincing and community building, factions characters play the slower game of intrigue and wit to acquire allies and assets for themselves, their factions and their party.

#### ![][image3]Magic

Ethereal movement, arcane sense and of course casting spells allow magical characters and creatures to solve problems laterally, by altering their very nature. They use their specialized abilities and magical equipment to alter major arcanum from the unremarkable into powerful yet subtle spells.

#### ![][image4]Recon

Spying, hunting, pathfinding, and logistics are largely up to recon focused creatures and characters, who make use of strategies and equipment like packs to overcome challenges set by the environment itself.

### 

### Basic Core Resolution

The core resolution mechanic is a 2d12 system that takes advantage of your strategic thinking and teamwork to overcome the harshness and dangers of the world.  
When faced with an uncertain task, you roll 2d12 and take the lower, unless you are buffed. If you are proficient in the action, you can expend energy or social credit to buff yourself, and you can also add your proficiency bonus. You can find other ways to buff yourself as you play.  
You can use actions described in each arena of play chapter to try to achieve results, described in chapter 6\.

### The General Rules

**Natural Abilities** are things your character can just do without any trouble, such as walking or seeing a flag 100m away. These are your natural abilities. If you want to do something that you are naturally able to do, you say that your character does it and it’s done. You use natural movement to travel long and short distances, and your primary sense to designate targets for other actions and abilities.  
Characters have **Two Primary Skills** that they use to do most activities.  
Skill descriptions will include details about **Proficiencies**, which are specific actions you can take to make checks while adding your skill bonus to the roll. If you try to do something that is outside the scope of any of your proficiencies, you may still attempt the action, but you don’t add your skill bonus to the roll.  
Anything you think you might be able to do, but you or your table are unsure would be successful, will require a **Skill Check**. Here are some examples:

* Maneuvers such as climbing a wall, jumping off a moving horse, or sliding down a hillside.   
* Martial actions such as attacking someone, shooting a bow or gun, or armwrestling.  
* Magic actions such as casting spells to affect objects or people or manipulating the ongoing effects of spells or magical creatures.  
* Faction actions such as investigating, dancing, disguising yourself, or convincing someone of something.  
* Recon actions such as pick pocketing, tracking, or setting up an attack.  
* Saves against anything that affects you, such as slipping on ice, blocking a punch, avoiding public humiliation, or recovering from poison.

If you are proficient in the action, you can expend one energy to **Buff** yourself, taking the higher number, and again adding your proficiency bonus if necessary.  
As you play the game you will uncover other ways to buff yourself and your allies. There is no way to modify your roll aside from buffing it, there are no static modifiers that will add or subtract to your roll, and your proficiency bonus is always equal to your level.  
Some things take a second, or even less **Time** such as throwing a ball (sphere), other things take hours or even days, such as throwing a ball (party). The time it takes to complete an action is defined as either tactical (seconds) or strategic (hours) to help convey some of the mechanical particularities with these time scales.

### Rolls and Results

Skills are defined uniquely, and so there may be gaps and overlaps in your character’s skills. For example, you might be proficient in driving civilian vehicles and also long distance urban travel. In both cases, you can apply your proficiency bonus (only once) to a check you make to drive a car along highways between cities, but you lose your proficiency bonus when trying to find an off-road route that would avoid police surveillance, since that is neither urban travel, nor how civilian vehicles are driven.

**To make a skill check**, roll 2d12, take the lower number, and then add a relevant skill bonus, if you have one.  
For example, you might add your martial skill to a maneuver that is clearly martial in nature, such as interposing yourself in the middle of a fistfight, or you might add your recon skill if it is something like running through tall grass or climbing a tree. 

**\[EXAMPLE\]**

##### Results

Whatever your roll is, you subtract the difficulty of the enterprise, either the base difficulty of the locale, or a passive or defensive skill in an opponent. Never an arbitrary number selected by the GM.

#### **For example**, if you swing a sword at someone and get 7-8, you take the 7 and add your skill bonus (+1), resulting in an 8\. If your opponent is only able to passively defend themselves with no skill modifier, their defense is 5, so your **result** is (8-5=) **3**.

Whatever the sum of your roll minus the difficulty, that number is your **result**. If the sum is below 0, you have missed entirely. If it is 0-4, you have hit. Sometimes dealing damage is key, so hitting with a 0 is ineffective. If the sum is above 5, you have achieved a **breakthrough**. Different actions will have different consequences, so a breakthrough in dancing is not going to be anything like a breakthrough when hacking a security camera system, but the basic result is the same; you do exceptionally well.

### Consequences

Results give a miss (below 0), a hit with no damage (0), a hit with damage (1-4), or a breakthrough (5+). These results are interpreted differently based on the type of action being performed, but generally speaking, you can understand them as indicating that you failed, a degree of success from 0-4, or a major turn of events. Succeeding with a degree of success of 0 is weird, but often useful.

* If you want to harm someone, you could miss, hit them with a degree of success from 0-4, or really hit them well.  
* If you are looking for information about something, you could find nothing, find a lead that gets you 0-4 data points, or find a really great piece of intel.  
* If you are looking to subdue a spell, maybe you can’t do so at all, can hold it off for 0-4 rounds, or even end the spell entirely.

The Consequence of your check is not the number value, but the narrative thing that happens because of the check.

#### When the consequence of failure of your check should harm you, you are performing a **Save**. In this case, a negative result of 1-4 or 5 or less is interpreted as a minor or major condition respectively.

It is not solely the GM’s responsibility to arbitrate consequences, other players can also do so.  
Consequences can be conceptualized into the following six possible outcomes to help translate the results of the various mechanics back into narratives.

**Damage**  
Harming another creature or object, usually to impose a physical, social or magical condition on them. Can be achieved by physical violence, spells, insults, traps, and many other means.

**Intelligence**  
Learning or establishing something about a target or the world. Achieved through interrogation, augury, asking around, surveillance, and other methods.

**Initiative**  
Setting up a situation where you are in the same place as a target, with the intent of doing so with some particular advantages such as positioning. Achieved through many ways including reacting quickly, teleportation, demanding they meet you, or setting up an ambush.

**Social Change**  
Altering the status of your relationship with another creature or faction, or the esteem they have of you relative to another creature or faction. Can be achieved through many mechanisms not limited to sports, using enchantments, debating your merits, or uncovering intriguing gossip.

**Position Change**  
Moving, not relative to geography, but in relation to a target creature such as wrestling, possession, racing, etc. Each position type has many different approaches such as maneuvering quickly, magically binding, creating an illusion, or hiding.

**Location Change**  
Moving yourself and possibly other creatures and objects relative to the geography, sometimes within a certain time. This can be done by physically moving your target quickly, telekinesis, calling upon a porter, finding a shortcut, etc.

##### Challenges

Usually, one skill check is not all that’s needed to solve a problem or get through a situation. Challenges are these problems or situations that will likely need a few skill checks, about 3-4 from each player as a maximum. A challenge has a starting situation and a resolution, but they can be generated by any of the players, or taken directly out of official content, which includes interesting challenge ideas. 

#### **\[EXAMPLE\]**

Ultimately the difficulty of the game from a player point of view is governed by the number of challenges, as the game is balanced so that challenges gradually erode energy, social credit, supply and equipment until the party has very little to protect them from the inherent dangers of the world.

## The Section Detailing the Basic Overview of Your Character {#the-section-detailing-the-basic-overview-of-your-character}

Your character is defined by three interconnected parts: their personality, their background, and their skills. None of these parts can be created in a vacuum, so it is impossible to generate a character without a context; both their party and the wider world.

### Personality

Your character’s personality includes the key features that identify and define them and are informed by the setting and your character’s background.

**Names** are key identifiers that also give us a place in society. Names are almost always given by others, and most cultures have important naming conventions that help situate you in your social groups.

**Physical Appearance** includes both anatomical data such as hair colour and cultural expressions such as hair style, both of which are often equally important.

**Auditory Cues** are used to facilitate role-play, make your character more memorable, and develop their upbringing and attitudes.

**Link to the Party** is a feature of all characters, including Player-Characters. It can include relationships, genealogy, social groupings, or simply commonalities that make you click with the party.

**Downtime Activities** help fill out your character and connect them to their skills, background and wider world. It’s also what you’re doing when you are caught unawares.

**Fate** is simultaneously how your character will exit the game, and also how they will level-up. How many times can you challenge your fate before it refuses to bend? Fate is usually presented as a mortal statement such as “I will die in a boxing match.”

### Background

Extensive, unique backgrounds are offered as setting-specific additions to published modules. They include suggestions on personality traits common to the background such as naming conventions of a certain society. They also include unique abilities granted only to those with the background, and access to additional abilities that can be learned or honed over your adventuring career regardless of their arena of play. These background abilities can, for example, give a fighter access to a spell or magical ability, or give a ranger access to an artistic talent or additional language. A starting background is found in the Appendix.

### Skills

Your character has 2 skills, which are deep, unique sets of proficiencies, abilities and context that drive the mechanics, personality and development of your character. Each skill belongs to one of the 4 Arenas of Play; martial, magic, factions or recon. You can choose two skills from the same arena. The skills themselves include starting proficiencies and abilities that are wide-ranging. There can be no exhaustive list of either skills or proficiencies, and overlaps and gaps are common. Skills often feature unique abilities found nowhere else in the game, but also make recommendations about more generic abilities within their arena of play. A selection of starting skills are found in the Appendix.

### Other Attributes

**Proficiencies** are defined by your background and skills. They are the things to which you can apply your proficiency bonus, and they are not bound by exhaustive lists or limitations on their definitions. You can be proficient in the use of all knives, or in understanding bird communications, or in navigating through forest terrain, or in navigating as long as you can see the moon. Each proficiency is a rule unto itself.  
**Bonuses**, whether skill, save, or proficiency are simply equal to your level. If you are level 4, your bonus is always \+4.  
**Passive Skill** is the ability you have to take on an action you are proficient with when you are not actively doing so, for example to walk over ice while you are actively scanning the horizon for danger, or to be aware of danger while you actively plod your way across the ice. It is always 5 \+ your proficiency bonus.  
**Energy** is used to buff your roll (take the higher dice), or to activate abilities. Because it’s used to buff your rolls and because you roll saves and active defenses, having no energy leaves you defenseless and more likely to suffer harm. When your energy is 0, you should flee. You can regenerate to half your energy by resting for an hour or completely regenerate it by resting for 8 hours.  
**Social Credit** is used like energy for faction interactions, buffing rolls and activating abilities.  
**Leveling Points** represent the limits on what your fate opens up to your character when they successfully challenge it. You get 2 when you level up (in addition to adding \+1 to your bonuses). You can use one levelling point to add a new ability from your background or skills, or to add a new proficiency, or to increase your max energy or max Social Credit by 1\.
