# **Chapter 5 : The “Recon” Arena of Play, Dealing with Travel, Intelligence, Ambushes and the Like**

Spies, scouts hunters and strategists all specialize first in finding their quarry, and ensuring that when they do so they are at their most vulnerable. Recon skills are required to either of these things, and to defend against them being done to you and your allies. Your passive recon score represents the habits and perceptive abilities you have cultivated over a lifetime, from ensuring supplies are properly packed away from light fingers, to shoulder-checking your flanks as you pass through a doorway. Your active recon skills include tracking, strategizing, and sneaking, all ways to establish an encounter against an enemy precisely when they least want you to.

## Recon Skills, Defined as Areas of Expertise and their Benefits

Those proficient in recon skills have an area of expertise. This is either a specific environment type a specific creature type, or a specific region from official content.  
If your area of expertise is in a specific terrain such as forests or coast, you can apply your recon skill to any actions you take in that terrain such as avoiding detection, foraging, establishing encounters, etc. You can think of a character with a recon skill based on a terrain type as a ranger, sailor or other expert navigator of that particular terrain.  
If your area of expertise is a specific creature type, such as constructs or fey, you can apply your recon skill to any recon actions taken against that creature type in any context. If a party includes multiple creature types, establishing an encounter against any one of them is sure to establish an encounter against all of them, but they may split up to confound your pursuit. You can think of a character with an encounter skill based on a creature type as a hunter or assassin of that particular creature wherever it goes.  
If your area of expertise is a specific region, you can apply your recon skill to any strategic actions that take place in that region. You can think of a character with an encounter skill based on a region as a smuggler or detective, versed in every back alley detail of the physical and humanoid geography of the region, and how it all fits together.

### Proficiencies

Recon characters are often proficient with the use of **tools and equipment** specific to their trade. This could be, for example climbing equipment, traps, or even a single hunting weapon such as a bow or gun. They are also usually able to convert supply to a wide range of setting-appropriate utility items dealing directly with their skill. For example, a coast or ocean expert in a modern setting can expend one supply to come up with a life preserver.  
In addition to proficiency in long-distance strategic movement over a terrain type if they are experts in that terrain, a recon character might also be proficient in a different form of **movement** such as swimming or climbing, or in a terrain type even though they are not an expert in that terrain.  
Wherever relevant, the **operation of vehicles** falls to recon characters. This could include horseback riding, operating carts, barges, ferries, or other watercraft, or any other vehicle, since they rely largely on observation, and spatial awareness along with significant physical ability and dexterity.

### Geography and Movement

Recon characters are responsible for the strategic movement of their party, usually operating as the navigator and often the pilot or driver as well. Regional specialists are considered proficient in all terrain types in their region, while terrain specialists are only proficient in their terrain and creature specialists are not proficient in strategic movement unless it is in direct relation to their quarry.  
Strategic movement takes place from one locale to another and the challenges faced by the party in strategic movement are usually broken down into steps that pit the Recon characters’ skill against the natural world, resulting in loss of equipment, time, or even injuries if they are failed. When you decide to move between two locales, you may do so naturally, for example if there is a road and you have a vehicle. You may also do so transactionally, for example buying a train ticket, or your GM may set out a challenge or short adventure for your party to travel if the transit would be complicated or unsure for some reason.

### Surveillance

Recon specialists are adept at using their skills to find information through observation and insights about behaviors and actions. Surveillance is the recon component of the Intel phase of play. It relies on physical clues and observations instead of background knowledge, word-of-mouth, or magical means. You are proficient at surveilling anything or any creature you can sense in a region or terrain that you are specialized in. You are proficient at surveilling any creature of a type that you are a specialist in, as well as objects that directly relate to it such as “its vehicle” or “the bag it put down”. You can also surveil an item in relation to a creature type, restricting the intel gathered in such a way as “does this belong to a vampire”, or “has this recently been in contact with a divine?”  
Check out the page on the Intel Phase for more information.

### Initiating an Encounter

If a party would like to find themselves in the same locale as another at an opportune time, whether for combat, espionage, negotiations, or any other reason, they must first initiate an encounter. Initiating an encounter takes one hour. At the end of the hour, the encounter is established.  
You do not need a check if an encounter has already been established narratively, however you may use a check to earn initiative points, detailed in Chapter 6\. An initiative check is made just like any other check, you roll against your target’s passive score, and they may have an opportunity to counter with an active defense to evade you. If you succeed, you convert any damage to initiative points, which are interpreted as tactical positioning and actions readied ahead of the tactical, round-by round actions.

## Recon Equipment, In Particular Mounts, Vehicles and Packs

### Packs and Supply

Packs are sets of equipment meant to serve a specific purpose. They can be purchased in a market. All packs have two functions. First, they have a use described in the pack’s description, usually conferring a buff or small static bonus, or the ability to perform an action in exchange for supply. Secondly, all packs can be used to retrieve specific items that the player wants that would conceivably be in the pack by spending one supply. For example, if a character has a camping pack, it is conceivable that they have a knife in it. They can expend one supply to retrieve their knife for a specific use or encounter.  
Supply is often used as a pseudo-currency. It can be found or acquired using encounter strategies and faction assets, and it’s a good thing to keep in stock. If your supply runs out, it’s assumed your equipment is being run down, falling into disrepair and being generally neglected to the point that it stops being useful. Lamps are running out of oil, ropes are being cut into smaller and smaller pieces, etc. Supply is usually sold in groups of 10\. Up to 10 supply fits into a pack, or on its own 10 supply is considered a medium bundle.  
You can only use supply to pull things out of a pack that would be in the pack. For example if you have 10 supply and a perfume pack, and your partner has 10 supply and a mountaineering pack, you can pull 10 different perfumes, bottles, etc, from your pack but no ropes, and your partner can pull 10 lengths of rope from their pack but no perfumes. You can trade supply to one another to make better use of your packs. Don’t think too hard about it.  
If you really want to try to turn supply into something reasonable, but no one has the corresponding pack, you can try to make an encounter check to come up with the item in question. For example, if your entire party is loaded out with adventure and dungeoneering and mountaineering packs and you suddenly need a paper and pen, you can try an encounter check to see if anyone happens to have something that will work. You can also just procure anything like that from a market for the cost of one supply. It is assumed you trade a rope or flashlight or something for a pen and paper.

### Mounts and Vehicles

Characters may come into possession of mounts or vehicles that they are proficient with, usually through a quest or faction, though in some settings certain mounts like horses are common market commodities. Platforms are almost always too complex and economically impactful to be market commodities, requiring specialized logistics to operate, and are therefore considered features of the geography or faction assets.

**Reactive Casting**  
You can expend 1 energy and 1 initiative point to prepare a spell with a casting time of one minute to be cast on your first turn in the ensuing encounter.

**Rush**  
If you win an encounter, you can spend one encounter point per target to ensure that the targets do not have their weapons or magic focuses drawn when the encounter starts.
