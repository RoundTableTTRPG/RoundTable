## The Section Detailing Different Terrain Types

### Common Environments

These are places that are friendly to human habitation, and so places where humans tend to frequent. You will find them as the core environments of your settings, especially in the early levels. Because they are easy to tame and live in, exploring and crossing them is trivial, low-tier business that many people do.

**Forest** environments are characterized by the complete domination of trees in temperate climates. These trees create a microclimate within a forest, changing the very weather, and are the primary concern of just about every other creature in the forest. The forest floor offers new clues for tracking prey, but may conceal common clues such as footprints. Waterways are often somewhat subject to the forest, being pushed around by fallen trees, and food sources including both plants and animals must live within the trees’ domain. An amateur might think a campfire can go unnoticed in a forest, not realizing that from below you cannot see the smoke signal, but from a few kilometres away it is clear as day. All these hazards must be carefully navagated by those who wish to become masters of the forest.  
A character trained in the forest terrain passes through the terrain of a forest floor as natural movement. They are also naturally capable of climbing trees, poles and other similar surfaces.

**Urban** environments are characterized by the alterations that humanoids have made to the natural setting. Whether they are human cities, kobold warrens or even dense farmland, creatures in an urban environment can hardly escape humanoid architecture. It takes a special mix of skills to make your way in an urban environment. Unlike natural worlds there is most often a great abundance of everything a humaniod might need to prosper, but this abundance is guarded behind norms, laws, social constructs and factions. An excellent urban ranger can find the commonalities between disparate peoples to earn or make their living in any urban centre, and even track people on the trackless cobblestones.  
A character trained in urban terrain can pass through crowds, debris and unusual terrain such as rooftops that would normally constitute reckless movment as their natural movement. They can also climb walls and buildings, and maneuver small gaps, drops, and squeezes such as windows and other barriers caused by urban development.

Whether it is the vast sahel, the steppe or the great prairie, enormous **Grasslands** can stretch for thousands of kilometers and constitute oceans or continents in their own right. It takes a skilled person to find sufficient food in this harsh environment, and often requires hunting large game over many miles. Moving unnoticed in steeply cut creek beds or badlands, and tracking those that do the same also requires a keen eye for life on the grasslands.  
Those trained in grasslands can move great distances with ease. Your natural strategic speed is 10km, the same as a horse. You can also ride one type of mount as natural movement.

Whether they are cold northern bogs or sweltering mangrove forests, Mediterranean reed deltas, or the bayou, **Swamps** represent areas where the ground and fresh water are mixed at the surface. They contain treacherous quicksands and mires and dangerous predators lurking in their shifting landscapes. Staying dry can be a life-or-death struggle as water swells from the skies above and the rising and twisting rivers below, and no assurance can be made that crossing once offers safe passage back. Those trained to move through swamps can swim and move naturally through shallow water, mud, and slippery surfaces.

Along the **Coast**, the land points toward the sea, and the sea points to the land as well. There is a place there, where the streams flow and the waves crash. The coastal environment is both of these places, land and water. The water is whatever is over 1km across, be it the ocean, a sea, a large lake, or even a very wide river. That water is the coast, and so too is the land around it. The interface is famously bountiful. And this bounty draws dangers. Huge sea storms crash onto land. Creatures grown massive from their terrestrial domains come to water. And many creatures live in this liminal place, caught in between.  
Those trained in coastal areas are naturally capable of swimming and wading through water, as well as remaining sure footed on watercraft.

Those unfamiliar with the **Shield** environment might use the word “boulder”, but what about when a rock is over 500m to a side? The shield is characterized first and foremost by granite and the landscape is dominated by the bedrock. This means whatever vegetation grows on tops has little purchase, and prefers the midland areas where dirt and debris has collected to form a thin suitable soil. The lower areas are covered in water, for it cannot drain through the rock, leaving innumerable irregularly shaped waterways which can often not be categorized easily as lakes or rivers. Crossing and recrossing these waterways is necessary, as is scampering over the occasional bare granite cliff. While the shield contains a suitable supply of food and an enormous amount of fresh water, its true bounty is in minerals, where all manner of gems and precious metals can be found in the innumerable granite outcroppings, and massive deposits lie just below the surface or underneath a lake.  
Those trained in the Shield can both climb and swim as natural movement.

### Inhospitable Environments

There are many places on the periphery of civilization that are too rugged for the common folk. They can be crossed with some danger, and small, specialized groups call them home permanently. When designing your world, you can separate areas using these inhospitable environments, then you can build links through them using more favorable terrain. For example, a chain of islands allow the coast to cut through an open ocean, a lush river valley spotted with swamps, grasslands and extensive farms creates a highway through a desert.

The cacophony of wildlife fills the world around the **Desert**, but nothing prepares visitors for the silence, the stillness, the death. Deserts can be filled with sand or rocks, or salt, or any other minerals. They can stretch for thousands of kilometers and offer nothing to those who would attempt to survive among them.  
Those trained to navigate deserts can see naturally in very bright light, and live, and take short rests in heat and cold. They can move naturally over shifting terrain and sand.

The steep cliffs and rugged sides of a **Mountain** break suddenly to reveal jagged peaks, barren slopes and glacier caps. Mountain landscapes can rise out of familiar terrain to reveal an alien world. They can jut out of a tropical jungle to plunge adventurers into snow and ice, or rise to such height that the air thins, the body weakens, and the organs simply fail. You can walk until your legs collapse beneath you, only to find you have crossed little more than a kilometer in a day, and yet a mountain range can stretch for hundreds of kilometers, cutting off otherwise close neighbors.  
Trained mountaineers have developed larger lungs that allow them to breathe naturally in air too thin for others. They can also move across snow, slopes and cliffs as natural movement.

The open **Ocean** is frequently seen as the most dangerous terrain that is naturally found in the world. It is a place wholly alien to humanity. What occurs beyound the misty blue line of the horizon, on a continent of water with towering waves, is beyond the imagination of most. Even there, rain is the only drinkable water, and the fish that are made into food can also present themselves as massive sharks. Whales evade dragons between the waves, so what hope does a land lover have of surviving here?  
Those trained for life on the open ocean can naturally swim. They are also able to rest in open water by floating on their backs, and can find sure footing on watercraft.

The **Jungle** is not like a forest. Where the huge trees modify the terrain and environment of a forest, the trees and plant life constitute a terrain in the jungle. You cannot move without stepping on the massive root structures of trees and pushing through thick vegetation. Frequently, the jungle floor does not see sunlight for years at a time as it is blotted out by the towering, thick canopy. Jungles frequently contain impassable vegitative structures, and the actual topography of travel through the jungle is dictated more by living and fallen trees and other plants than it is by the natural rise and fall of the land. Forests can modify the climate, but jungles can contain microclimates between their canopy and floor unlike what is experienced outside them.  
Those trained in jungle terrain are able to climb and pass over slippery terrain or that obstructed by vegetation as natural movement, and swim.

There are lands in the natural world that plunge below the freezing point of water periodically, but one of the most alien landscapes is the **Frozen** places of the world that only rarely rise to melting temperatures. When they are warmest, these places see snowfall, not rain, and when they are coldest, it’s too cold even to snow. Mammals who live here must seek refuge in huge fat supplies and shelter from the cold. Insects are rare, birds migrate away, and the land is left desolated. Starvation is unlikely only because the sheer cold is almost sure to kill you first. Even in the warm seasons, ice is found on glaciers, on the surface of the water, and a few inches below the ground.  
Those trained in Frozen encounters can take short rests while cold, see in extremely bright and dim light, and pass naturally over slippery terrain and snow.

### The Unseen Worlds

There are places that are not connected by direct geography, but through the ethereal veil that covers the world and permeates it with magical energies. When creating a world you should decide if the unseen worlds constitute whole planes of existence, geographically connected to themselves, or pockets where these strange places exist, or some combination. Also decide whether or not these locations can co-exist. Can an area that experiences a connection with the Feywild also be connected to the Deep? Can one travel from the Primordial realms to Abqaria without passing through the mortal world? Travel to the unseen worlds is also dictated by distinct circumstances, but powerful magic users can forge links to them outside these conditions.

The Land of Genius, the abode of the Muses, the City of Jinn, **Abqaria** is an expansive realm that rests on the state of aloofness and distraction one finds in deep thought, flow or inspiration. It is found when one loses their interest or grip on the mortal world, and so can often be discovered simply by an impassioned and driven seeking of it. Its entire sky is luminous in an even white light, blinding to behold and never dimming. Its inhabitants are elementals that can turn ethereal and fly at will, making doors and passages unnecessary. Though its wilderness is an endless and featureless desert with no food or water, it is spotted with oases of incredible luxury and marvelous works: Kasbahs. These are fortified cities of craftspeople, artists, magicians and inventors that are usually very progressive, and their aloof and fortified nature as well as powerful inhabitants allow them to stand against the covetous mortal factions that would tear them apart to feast on their riches.  
Someone trained in Abqari encounters can move over sand naturally, can rest in hot weather and see through bright light as well as see elementals who have made themselves ethereal.

Beyond the touch of sunlight lies the **Deep**. Whether it is a jungle floor enshrouded in perpetual darkness, a subterranean labyrinth, or the Midnight Zone of the open ocean, the Deep represents all that lies beyond the reach of natural light. There are tales of ancient and treacherous passages under mountains or even under seas, caves with no up or down, even subterranean worlds complete with jungles and intelligent life, and yet, to most, these remain cautionary tales against shunning the light of the sun, not directions to adventure. Transitions into the Deep are dark passages that seem to flicker or disappear in direct lighting.  
Those trained in the Deep can squeeze, climb and move across debris and slippery terrain naturally as well as see in dim light.

The Land of the Fae, Alfheimr, the **Feywild** is the homeland of the fey creature type. It is perpetually dark, with no sun, but a very large and luminous moon as well as frequent auroras that descend from the sky to ground level, thus illuminating it with dim light. The large trees that cover the Feywild use this dim light to grow extremely slowly, creating exotic and extremely dense woods. These forests are populated by fey creatures as well as frequent Terrestrial and Cthonite visitors. Parts of the Feywild are also associated with the afterlife of certain terrestrial humanoids, who rise in the Feywild after they die in the mortal realms. Passages to the Feywild must be dimly lit, usually by twilight or dawn, and they are often found at gates such as standing stones or cairns that physically manifest the passing from the mortal world to elsewhere. These passages can also be naturally occurring places that represent that change, such as the edge of a dark forest or swamp, or the boundary of a thick fog.  
Those trained in the Feywild can see in dim light and pass through vegetation and shallow water naturally. They can also see fey or undead who have attempted to make themselves invisible.

The land of one thousand islands is the sea or perhaps the inverted archipelago of seas that exists in the liminal space called **Manatuana**. Virtually every land near water speaks of a moving island, or an island that rises and falls at certain times of year, or the island to which the spirits of the dead are ushered. These islands all together constitute Manatuana, the plane of liminal islands. Usually these islands have ports between them, and they can be travelled as easily as any other island chain, however each island has only one tether to the mortal world, one condition under which people may travel to and from Manatuana. Perhaps the condition of one island is that it can only be found by the undead, and travelling back takes place on one specific day of the year. Perhaps its neighboring island appears in the eye of a hurricane every June. Perhaps another can be sought out any time of the year, but only found after one has permission from a certain primordial. Whatever the condition of the gate to the mortal realms, it is usually enough to dissuade most travelers and earn the skepticism of the rest.  
Those trained in Manatuana can naturally move on water vessels and can swim.

Some say the world was once roamed only by primoridals, and that they created **Primordial Realms** for one another that now constitute various other environments. But sometimes, in places widely understood as sacred, a path will open to reveal a realm untouched by all that has transpired since this ancient time. If this primordial land’s guardian is peaceful, such a bountiful garden can seem to be a sublime Eden, and sometimes humanoids contrive a fate such that they will rise undead in these beautiful places once they die. If, on the other hand, this realm’s sovereign is wrathful, a profound darkness seeps from this wound and contaminates the neighboring realms, and the primordial environment itself is a wasteland of polluted land, water and air, and its creatures are wretched abominations.  
Those trained to walk primordial realms are natural acrobats who can leap, swing, and climb as natural movement. They can also naturally recognize a primordial who has shapeshifted or otherwise taken a more mundane form.

# Glossary

**Ability \[Play|Spell|Asset|Strategy\]**  
Abilities are discrete actions a creature can perform, sometimes with an associated energy, supply or social credit cost that have a mechanical effect.  
Natural Abilities are abilities that are granted by virtue of a creature's basic nature and physical characteristics.  
Background Abilities are abilities that are granted by virtue of a character’s background.  
Each Arena of Play uses a particular word to describe its abilities, however they are functionally identical within the idicyncracies of their arena of play. Plays are Martial Abilities, Spells are Magic Abilities, Assets are Faction Abilities and Strategies are Recon Abilities.

**Arena of Play**  
A mode of understanding actions in a mechanical context as being either martial, magical, faction or recon based.

**Breakthrough**  
A result that is more than 5 points above the difficulty, indicating an unqualified success or major shift in outcomes as dictated by the narrative.

**Buff \[Debuff\]**  
Take the higher of the two dice rolled. You can do this by expending energy for physical and magical actions, social credit for faction actions, and various other methods found elsewhere. Having multiple reasons to be buffed has no effect.  
Debuff is to prevent the higher die from being taken. Debuffs always overcome any number of buffs, so if there are 3 reasons a creature is buffed and only one reason it is debuffed, it takes the lower die.

**Challenge \[Fate Challenge\]**

A challenge is a series of checks set out to accomplish a narrative goal that has both a success and fail state, and uncertainty of either.

A fate challenge, usually the culmination of a series of other challenges, is a challenge that a player would like to use to challenge their character’s fate. The success state is tied to the character levelling up, and the fail state indicates that the character is permanently retired or dies.

**Character**  
A Character is a Humanoid with a Personality.

**Check \[Skill Check | Save\]**  
A check is a roll to test the consequences of an action. If the result of failure would impose a condition on the one executing the action, it is called a save.

**Conditions \[Minor and Critical\]**  
Conditions are afflictions that alter how a character can access their abilities, skills, proficiencies, buffs and other features.  
Minor conditions can reduce access to or effectiveness of some skills and abilities. Critical conditions reduce the character to a barely playable state.  
Unless otherwise stated, conditions can be relieved over the course of a long rest.Temporary conditions end at the end of a challenge. Permanent conditions cannot be overcome in a long rest and require a narrative solution (quest).

**Consequence**  
The narrative effect that takes place because of a check or save, which often has a mechanical component as well.

**Creature**  
A creature is an object, composite or swarm with an intrinsic ability to act upon the world.

**Damage**  
The number result of a check or save where the consequence is the application of a condition.

**Difficulty \[Base\]**  
The defense number for a check against an inanimate object, geography, etc. The difficulty operates identically to the passive defense of a creature in that a check is compared against it to determine a consequence of an action.  
Base Difficulty of a region, faction or locale is the assumed difficulty to take any unsure action regarding that geography or polity, for example to cross a river or find a market.  
The GM never arbitrates difficulties, they are based on the base difficulty, a stated creature’s passive skills, or on the party level \+5.

**Encounter**  
The meeting of two or more parties in a locale where they can sense eachother and interact meaningfully. Often intentionally contrived narratively or through an initiative check.

**Energy \[Max\]**  
The stored biochemical energy you can exert to undertake exceptional actions, including buffing actions, casting spells and using martial plays.  
A human’s max energy starts at 2 and can be increased by 1 by using a levelling point, representing increased overall fitness and efficiency at their usual actions.

**Ethereal**   
Anything without substantive physical form, such as smoke, mist, or arcane ether. Ethereal things have a location in the physical world, but they can share their space with any number of other ethereal things or any number of physical things that also fit in that space. They can move through most materials except iron, lead and certain other materials you designate for your setting, though most materials would be considered difficult terrain. Only those materials they cannot cross can be used to physically harm ethereal creatures or objects. Ethereal things are not necessarily invisible, nor are they necessarily visible. Their default visibility depends on the nature of their etherealness. Ethereal creatures cannot be tracked using terrain type, since they do not interact with terrain very much. They can still be tracked using their creature type or locality. Ethereal creatures cannot interact with physical objects, including iron or lead.

**Graduated Check**  
The repetition of a nearly identical check, which therefore takes place over the next higher time scale. For example, a check to open a door as an action can be re-taken using identical methods, characters and tools, but it will then be taken as a minute-long check. It could again be re-taken but as a ten-minute long check, etc.

**Humanoid**  
A Creature that is capable of communicating and understanding communication, forming and understanding complex social bonds, and therefore acting in and being subject to the factions arena of play. The exact definition can be elusive, but you could consider whether or not a creature would be reasonably capable of articulating the Prisoners’ Dilemma as a benchmark. Not all creatures that can communicate are humanoids. It does not refer to their silhouette or physical characteristics in any way.

**Locale**  
An area, usually less than 300m to a side, that represents a discrete tactical unit. It cannot easily be entered or exited or circumvented, has defined edges and an identity such as “the bowling alley” or “around the pond”. It can therefore be targeted by checks such as initiative, investigations and some spells, and it is the unit by which initiative usually sets up and tactical challenges are undertaken.

**Points \[Intel | Initiative\]**  
The numeric result of an intel or initiative check, usually used to establish the number of data points or preparatory actions available as a consequence of each check respectively.

**Proficiency \[Bonus\]**  
The knowledge of how to do something and practice of being able to do it, expressed mechanically by adding your proficiency bonus (equal to your level) to a roll to come out with a result.

**Rest \[Short|Long\]**  
A period in which a character engages in physical and mental recovery, often reclining, relaxing, eating, sleeping, socializing and engaging in their downtime activity. In order to rest, a creature must be in an environment that they can naturally survive indefinitely, including an appropriate temperature and moisture, the ability to change positions, etc.  
A short rest takes one hour and consumes one ration, and allows the creature to recover energy up to half its maximum energy, so if its maximum is 6, it can only regain energy to come up to 3\.  
A long rest takes 8 hours, and requires the creature to consume one ration and have access to water for washing and drinking, and for the creature to fall asleep. At the end of a long rest, a creature restores all its energy and social credit, and can either eliminate a minor condition or reduce a critical condition to its minor form.

**Result**  
The Result of a check or roll is the numerical value of the chosen die plus proficiency. For example, if you roll 2 and 7 and have a proficiency of \+6, your result is 8 unless you buff the roll, in which case it is 15\.

**Roll**  
The numbers that appear on the dice when they are rolled such as 8-11 or 2-7.

**Sense \[Primary\]**  
The ability that a creature uses to perceive the world. All creatures have a primary sense, which is specifically defined if it is not equivalent to human vision. The primary use of a sense is to designate targets, so a creature must be obscured from its opponents primary sense to avoid being targeted. A creature can use non-primary senses to try to designate targets, but does so within the limits of that sense and without proficiency.

**Social Credit \[Max\]**  
Some combination of your charisma, wealth, family background, fame, and the myriad other things that guide peoples’ perception of you and your ability to get people to do what you want.  
Humans start with 1 max social credit and can add additional social credit by using  levelling points, representing their increased fame, wealth, knowledge, or skill in social circles.

**Supply**  
Stuff you have. It remains undefined until such a time as you need to use it for something, at which time it takes on a form that is narratively plausible based on your surroundings, character, skills, packs or other narrative reasoning.

**Target**  
Many abilities, especially spells, require you to target a creature, object or location. You must be able to sense targets using your creature’s natural primary sense. For most characters this means you must be able to see them. Creatures that are hidden are presumed to be hidden from this sense, no matter what it is, meaning they cannot be targeted.  
Humans’ primary sense is sight, but we also have considerable spatial sense. For that reason, humans can target such creatures as “the creature beneath the blanket” or “the figure in the dark,” even if their exact nature is obscured, we can see enough of them to put their body together spatially. In total darkness, humans cannot target creatures even if they can feel or hear them. As long as you can use your primary sense to sense them, you can target them. This means humans can target through mirrors or remote viewing. Other creatures such as dogs would use their own primary sense, smell, to the same effect. If you are aware of the primary sense of a creature, you can make an ordinary encounter check to hide from their primary sense and prevent them from targeting you.

**Time \[Tactical | Strategic\]**  
Tactical time takes place in discrete rounds, with each opposing side taking one turn each round to undertake their tactical maneuvers and actions. Overall, tactical challenges usually take less than one minute, with each round representing a few seconds. Tactical challenges usually address tactically relevant uncertainties, for example rushing to get onto a train that is currently departing. Generally, martial actions are tactical (take a few seconds) unless otherwise stated or narratively obvious.  
Strategic time takes longer. The intervals are one hour, in which time all parties simultaneously conduct their strategic actions. If there is an uncertainty when it comes to which such actions take place first, the answer is usually resolved tactically. For example, if two parties are trying to get to a nearby town, a tactical challenge to board the train may determine which party arrives minutes before the other. Generally, Faction and Recon checks are strategic (take one hour) unless otherwise stated or narratively obvious.

This means humans can target through mirrors or remote viewing. Other creatures such as dogs would use their own primary sense, smell, to the same effect. If you are aware of the primary sense of a creature, you can make an ordinary encounter check to hide from their primary sense and prevent them from targeting you.

**Time \[Tactical | Strategic\]**  
Tactical time takes place in discrete rounds, with each opposing side taking one turn each round to undertake their tactical maneuvers and actions. Overall, tactical challenges usually take less than one minute, with each round representing a few seconds. Tactical challenges usually address tactically relevant uncertainties, for example rushing to get onto a train that is currently departing. Generally, martial actions are tactical (take a few seconds) unless otherwise stated or narratively obvious.  
Strategic time takes longer. The intervals are one hour, in which time all parties simultaneously conduct their strategic actions. If there is an uncertainty when it comes to which such actions take place first, the answer is usually resolved tactically. For example, if two parties are trying to get to a nearby town, a tactical challenge to board the train may determine which party arrives minutes before the other. Generally, Faction and Recon checks are strategic (take one hour) unless otherwise stated or narratively obvious.
