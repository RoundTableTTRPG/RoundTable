# Creature Types

### Terrestrials

Terrestrials are mundane creatures that ultimately extract their energy from sunlight. They do not have innate magical powers as a creature category, though some individuals can exhibit the ability to control magic. For example, horses are Terrestrials as they eat photosynthesizing plants and are not magical, though it is possible to find one that could exhibit magical characteristics as an individual. Terrestrials are usually extremely abundant low level creatures.

**Natural Abilities**  
Round Table was created by terrestrials, and so takes many of their common attributes for granted such as seeing light and using chemical energy to effect physical movement.

**Sub-Types**  
Beasts are the largest subtype of terrestrials and include mammals, reptiles, amphibians and birds. Beasts include extinct animals such as dinosaurs.  
**Plants** are terrestrial growths. They usually don’t move and use photosynthesis to grow. Some plants can move or be magically altered to become mobile or carnivorous, but are still considered plants and therefore terrestrials. Plants can be poisonous, or in rare cases venomous. Plants are unique in that they can define a terrain type such as forests or grassland, and can also constitute rough terrain, cover and other features.  
**Fish** are another somewhat unusual subtype of terrestrials because they breathe water instead of air and swim without the ability to move on land. Terrestrial fish are the fresh or salt water varieties that live within the illuminated surface area of bodies of water.  
Humanoid terrestrials are the most common humanoid sub-type and include **Humans**.

### Constructs

Constructs are creatures that are comprised of mechanical and arcane materials and energy with individual components that do not lend life to the whole. A pile of bones or body parts is understood as “dead,” and those parts are not useful for any purpose but their former use as parts of a creature. Assembling them does not make them function, nor does it make the assembly “alive.” Somehow, the assembly of certain non-living materials and energies in certain ways does create utility or even something some might argue is “life.” These assemblies are Constructs, and their nature, alive or not, is the source of controversy and confusion for many. Constructs need not be humanoid thinking androids, they can be simple arcane or even mundane machines. The boundary and definition of construct is a key theme in any game including significant use of constructs. Don’t shy away from it. Let your party wrestle with it and decide whether a trap or a wagon is “construct” enough to be considered a creature. At what point does a construct stop being a construct? Is the severed arm of a construct a second construct? The finger? A single length of its pipe? These are questions for you to answer in your setting.

**Natural Abilities**  
Constructs are usually fundamentally different from other creatures. By default, constructs do not need to eat or breathe. They do need energy, which they may acquire from rest or from some other source such as a battery or spell components, so you should define how constructs in your setting regain expended energy. Similarly, constructs very rarely heal themselves, and instead must be repaired. Some can repair themselves, others rely on outside sources for repairs.

**Sub-types**  
**Clockworks** are mechanical constructs that are usually mundane in nature, though sometimes powered arcanely. They are usually powered by a crank and use a series of gears to deliver that power to achieve their extremely limited number of possible tasks.  
**Remnants** are constructs made of the flesh and bones left behind after death. It is important to remember that they are not undead. The undead are disembodied spirits. Their bodies, if they are made to wander after death, are constructs.  
Humanoid constructs are usually called **Androids**. They are extremely complex and may even have the capacity to be possessed by human minds, however the thing that makes them humanoids is that even without hosting another humanoid, they are capable of complex thought and socializing. A human shaped construct is not necessarily humanoid.

### Cthonites

Cthonites are underground, underwater and deep space creatures, those with strange bodies living in alien ecosystems of the Deep. Cthonites can be identified by the fact that they have many limbs and eyes compared to similar terrestrials, bioluminesce, and that there are no herbivores among them. There are plenty of omnivores, but there are not enough plants in the Deep to sustain a creature through all its life cycles, so even relatively harmless creatures such as caterpillars might have a dark side. They are predatory creatures of darkness that live primarily in the Deep, but can be found infesting many dark places in the surface realms.

**Natural Abilities**  
In addition to climbing and squeezing as natural movement, Cthonites can perceive their world in complete darkness, whether they do this through touch, bioluminescence, or some other sense is up to you. You can also choose to allow them to bioluminesce to communicate or to help see or be recognized in total darkness. The bioluminescence is rarely bright enough to be seen even in dim light, or to shed dim light on an area.

**Sub-types**  
**Mushrooms, lichens, mold** and other fungi are cthonite growths. They rarely move, though they are often poisonous, and they are just as often useful spell components.  
**Insects and spiders** are tiny cthonite creatures with exoskeletons and many legs. They are often venemous, and the varieties originating in the Deep can grow to be several dozens of kilograms. They are extremely strong for their size and make formidable opponents, especially when they are parts of colonies that can number in the tens of thousands of members.  
**Deep Fish** are aquatic cthonites that include cephalopods. They usually have very strange body shapes, many limbs, bioluminescence and sometimes also venom. In rare cases such as octopuses, they can squeeze and climb just like their terrestrial cousins.  
**Humanoid Cthonites** may include any sort of subterranean creature that has gained intelligence and society, including ant-people or underground elves.

### Divines

Divines are creatures who originate in a world outside of our own, often in many worlds outside of our own. This force imposes itself, usually upon humanoids, in a cosmic competition with the primordial spirits, often for the undead souls of humanoids. The exact nature of this conflict, how it is played out, and the ultimate source and goal will be different for every setting, but the divines represent a significant force in the universe that can be used to achieve great good. Whether or not this is borne out in practice is up to you, as there is absolutely no expectation that the divines are aligned with goodness, though the gods often use cults to define goodness around their own moralities.

**Natural Abilities**  
Divines have the natural ability to perform magic as their primary skill. Their bodies may also be impervious to mortal weapons. They do not need to eat or breathe, but they do need to spend a significant amount of time resting to recover lost energy, and they must do so on an altar. Divines can sometimes procreate through the creation of children, and sometimes have the power to grant apotheosis; to transform another creature type into a divine.

**Sub-types**  
**Demi-gods** are monstrosities that include divines. They can be any type of divine attached to any other creature, for example a fish that has eaten and become fused with an idol, or a regular everyday human whose mother is human and whose father is a god, or whose great-great-great grandmother is a god who gave birth to her ancestor, three magic fish and a spear, all of which are demi-gods. Demi-gods, like most monstrosities, exhibit traits of both sides of their nature but usually more detrimentally than beneficially. Demi-gods often search for their non-divine side to be granted apotheosis so they can become fully divine.  
**Demons** and their humanoid versions, devils, could play an important role in your game. Their exact nature in relation to the rest of the divines is up to you, but they are characterized as those in direct and necessary opposition to the divines, creating a clearly defined “good” and “evil.” Some might say they were created by the divines just to create such a distinction.  
**Idols** are divines that have taken the form of an inanimate object. They can communicate telepathically and can cast spells without moving or making a sound. They can sometimes assume an ethereal form to interact with the world around them, though they frequently enchant others to do their bidding instead. Idols, like magic objects, cannot be destroyed by mundane means.  
Humanoid divines, usually called **Gods**, socialize somewhat with eachother, but seem to socialize excessively with weaker humanoids, who they are much more likely to collect into a cultish faction beneath them. Pantheons of associated divines usually collect themselves exclusively to protect themselves from being killed by eachother or other powerful creatures so they can be left to toy with the lesser folk in relative peace.

### Draconids

Draconids are arcanavores. They are creatures that acquire their energy from magic. Collecting massive heaps of magic items, spell components, focuses, even altars to sleep on only forms part of their quest for power. They are also unusually capable of destroying magic items using dragonfire, an explosive arcane reaction that tears magic from its tethers in the physical world. Dragonfire is not necessarily a breath weapon, many draconids keep it in their bellies to melt magic items they eat. Once rendered into smoke or dust in this way, the magic from a destroyed magic item can be consumed by draconids like food. Their scaly skin protects them from physical damage, and the magic residues in it protect them from magic as well. Draconids sometimes also exhibit feathers, and often have wings, whether or not they use them to fly, and can have anywhere from zero to dozens of legs.

**Natural Abilities**  
Draconids exist more in the arcane world than their closely related kin; the terrestrials and cthonites. They are arcanavores, meaning they eat spell components rather than food and are the only creatures that can naturally destroy magic items, by using their dragon fire to consume them. They usually hibernate, which is to say they take long rests that can last days or even decades. Draconid skin usually confers damage reduction to physical or magical attacks or both and draconids usually sense magic directly as their primary sense.

**Sub-types**  
**Dragoneaters** are an audacious, subcategory of draconids that actually hunt, kill and eat other draconids. Usually preying on the young or those hibernating, dragoneaters include behirs and wyverns, both lacking breath weapons or strong magic, but both packing dragoneater poison, a powerful venom that can paralyze and kill draconids of any size. After gorging themselves, dragoneaters only need to hibernate for a matter of days before they can be on the hunt again, and they can go over a year between meals. They are also shameless scavengers, and will descend upon a dragon carcass in terrifying squabbling flocks.  
**Drakes** are classical European style dragons with two or four legs, scales, no feathers, and wings. They breathe fire and/or dragonfire that looks like fire. They usually live in cycles that include long hibernation periods before they emerge to devastate the landscape until they have destroyed the entire ecosytem and consumed all the magic, then they hibernate some more. This apocalyptic cycle is revered by humanoids who live in drake-infested lands, but it also serves to protect the drakes, as they end up killing all the young dragoneaters and the humanoids in the area so they are not ambushed when they go back to sleep. Drakes can usually only benefit from a long rest that lasts longer than 100 years.  
**Wyrms** are draconids with any number of legs, with or without wings, but who have very long, serpentine bodies. Wyrms do not go through the same apocalyptic cycles as drakes, but can become equally powerful over their extremely long lifetimes. They hibernate, and usually focus on creating a hoard of magic items and altars powerful enough to give them restful sleep instead of consuming all the magic they can find in a reign of terror. As they hiberate, they periodically exhale dragonfire and slowly burn their entire hoard to magic smoke, which they then breathe over the course of their hibernation. Magic smoke leaking out of a mountain is a telltale symptom of a great wyrm living nearby.  
Humanoid draconids are called **Dragons**. They may be drakes or wyrms with the ability to talk and socialize, or they may even be capable of shapeshifting into human-like forms. They still consume magic items, but may either install themselves at the top of cults to themselves to force other humanoids to bring them what they need, or socialize with other dragons to form powerful alliances or cultures among themselves.

### Elementals

Elementals are creatures that are composed primarily of a single element and who are animated by arcane energies. They are not created by humanoids, but are naturally occurring and self-proliferating, and their bodies are made of their element, not of inert pieces attached together. Elementals usually come from elemental planes, and can be composed of pure individual elements such as titanium, mixed or abstract elements such as stone, or even energies such as light or abstract concepts like love.

**Natural Abilities**  
Elementals naturally have either an ethereal or physical form. Sometimes they can shapeshift only into a familiar physical or ethereal form that they also use frequently. Usually both of these forms are elements. For example, an ice mephit may be able to shapeshift into water vapor, but its natural form is ice. Elementals are not naturally immune or resistant to their element or energy type. Humans are largely made of bones, but if you shove a bone into a human, they usually die. Similarly, an elemental made of fire would die if you shoved a bunch of fire into it. Elementals are naturally proficient with magic though, so they often have transmutative and other magical abilities that make it hard to kill them with their chosen element.

**Sub-types**  
There are many **elemental growths**. In places far from the terrestrial realm, elemental growths such as gemstone crystals and ore veins make up the primary food source for many creatures and sometimes constitute considerable dangers due to poison or self-replication on or inside the bodies of nearby hosts.  
**Mephits** are small elemental creatures that can easily be enchanted or otherwise coerced to work for humanoids. Much like pets, they are intelligent enough to obey simple commands, but not enough to be affected by politics. They are loyal to a master who has raised them and can trained and bred.  
Humanoid elementals are called **Jinn**. They live in the elemental planes in much the same way other humanoids inhabit their own planes, though they are more likely to cross over into other realms because of their magical nature, and because of that nature they are seen as powerful magical beings.

### Fey

Fey are magical creatures from either a liminal realm parallel to your primary material plane, or a parallel plane of existence all together. Fey are usually magical reflections or refractions of material realities, so they resemble terrestrials in many ways, but they are magical in nature. A jackolope, for example, resembles a hare, but it has antlers, and more importantly it can hop into ethereal space to escape capture. Crossings into the fey realms are liminal or reflective places such as pools of still water, mirrors in the dark, mirage oases, or the twilight of a thick canopied forest. You decide whether the feywild represents isolated ethereal regions of your prime material worlds, or is a single contiguous realm of its own. The fey and the feywild also have a strange relationship with time. The feywild may not exist at all times, its chronology may run in fits and starts, fey realms may be frozen in time, and its denizens are often unaging, or its visitors age extremely rapidly.

**Natural Abilities**  
Fey can pass through the ethereal boundaries of their homelands without issue. You can decide if this extends to the entire feywild, or only a specific realm, time or gate. Fey are universally magic and do not need to use spell focuses. Fey usually have innate spells that they can cast, and most fey creature rely on these spells instead of physical abilities, so a fey deer may turn invisible instead of running, and a fey coyote may enchant its prey instead of ambushing it.

**Sub-types**  
**Fell Beasts** are shadow-fey. They usually inhabit shadowy realms of the feywild, sometimes close to or bordering the realms of the undead. They harbor immense malice and hatred and are probably the closest things to truly evil creatures by nature. You may decide that the shadow realms constitute a separate realm from the feywild, or a realm within it, and the civilizations of your world may consider fell beasts to be evil fey or not fey at all, or an exact reflection of the good fey.  
Humanoid fey are **Elves**. They are usually considered aloof and could be a race of lone individuals that merely reflect human nature such as nymphs, or they could be a colonial empire rising out of the fey mists to rule the material plane benevolently or maliciously. Their natural magical abilities and ethereal nature usually instill awe and fear in other races

### Primordials

Primordials are the spirits of the material world that existed long before the arrival of the divines or the development of humanoids. Whether they predate the formation of the universe, created it themselves, or were created along with it, their time scale is beyond the ken of mere mortals. They often exist as paradigmatic spirit representations of other creatures. Their innate magical power, immense knowledge and wisdom, and meticulous approach to interacting with the world make them a source of awe and wonder, even in their most minute or banal forms.

**Natural Abilities**  
Primordials are naturally attached to their creature type and their locale. It is unheard of for a primordial to move from one place to another, and much more likely that if an environment becomes unsuitable for them they will transform into a monstrous and tyrannical form of themselves to turn the environment back. All primordials are primarily recon-based creatures, often with considerable magical power as well, and they usually resemble a chosen terrestrial in most physical abilities, though they are very frequently shape shifters.

**Sub-types**  
**Paragons** are the original, perfect archetypes of a species. There is usually only one paragon, though it sometimes has both a male and female body or can transform between the two. Paragons maximize all physical abilities of the species and often have additional magical qualities as well, even if they are the paragon of a species that is not naturally magical. Paragons are usually 5 levels higher than their offspring species at its peak and can be paragons of any species except constructs, divines or undead. It is said that the paragon of the Drakes, for example, is the dreaded Tiamat who slumbers beneath the universe and will rise one day to consume it all. A paragon that is defeated will usually emerge in a slightly new evolution meant to overcome whatever defeated the last one. Meanwhile, the species will wither and die, and a new one reflecting the new primordial will become dominant. Paragons can also be buried or otherwise restrained, causing them to go dormant and their species to go extinct until they are reawakened. The domestication of wild animals is done through the defeat or befriending of their paragon.  
**Land Spirits** are the embodiments of terrain features such as rivers, islands or glaciers. They can usually transform into the terrain in question at will and sometimes come into conflict with humanoids who would alter the land. They must be appeased or defeated, or else the land will refuse to change and the spirit may become wrathful. Similarly, these spirits can unexpectedly go dormant, or even shift their location slightly, causing massive upheaval for the creatures who rely on them. A land spirit that is defeated will usually be reborn in its new form as a protector of the new status-quo.  
**Humanoid primordials** are very uncommon. Primordials do not interact with factions on a daily basis, and do not typically act fast enough to keep up with politics. They usually take an entire day to take any action, and may slumber for a year or more at a time. 

### Undead

It’s important to keep in mind that the designation of undead in Round Table is meant to indicate the disembodied spirits of the formerly living, and not their re-animated bodies. Re-animated bodies are considered constructs. With that out of the way, undead can be understood as primarily ethereal creatures whose unlife is limited to their ability to acquire life force directly from the living. In this way undead are not evil, but their nature precludes them from interacting positively with living things. Anything living could be undead, but the undead tend to be rapidly anihilated by the chaotic process of dying. If they do somehow pull through unscathed, the undead cannot rest without taking their energy from the living and they are constant slaves to entropy in a much more acute way than the living are.

**Natural Abilities**  
Undead are ethereal in nature. With enough energy, they can sometimes summon a physical form. Undead can often possess creatures. Undead lose one energy every day that they persist. Once they are out of energy, they take wounds instead. Minor undead usually face this annihilation with no hope but to find a necromancer capable of giving them energy, however more powerful undead can extract energy from the living themselves.

**Sub-types**  
**Ashjar al-Jalad** are undead growths such as deathbed mosses, banshee mushrooms, waqwaq and zaqum trees or kelpies. They are growths that derive their energy from devouring the souls of the dead, and often use that energy to bind those souls, attracting more to die around them.  
**Vengeful Spirits** have a bone to pick. They have a singular goal which can provide them with a long rest, such as killing the children of a certain family, killing those who killed them, calling people to drown in the bog they drowned in, etc. After this goal is completed, they can rest and then rise at their full power once more to do it again. They may seem like humanoids because of their memories and complex mannerisms, but they are the hate that remains alive in the heart of a dead person. They cannot be reasoned with, and ignore all faction interactions. They are beasts hungry for their singular goal and nothing else.  
**Corporeal undead** have not been entirely disembodied. They use an ethereal or astral form to affect the outside world, but they are trapped in their body. If their body is destroyed, including through decomposition, they are annihilated. Corporeal undead who choose this fate usually mummify or otherwise preserve their bodies and keep them safely stored away. Corporeal undead looking for release will try to bring creatures to their body to destroy it. Unlike other undead, corporeal undead do not lose energy every day, though they cannot rest.  
Humanoid undead, or **Ghosts**, are fairly common, since it is most often humanoids who have devised a way to persist after their corporeal death. They retain all the memories of their life and usually still see the world from the paradigm of their living selves, so they tend to take forms and do things in ways that seem almost foolishly human. You may find a ghost walking, for example, even though its feet are incapable of touching the ground.

### Creature Sub-types

**Growths**  
Growths are mindless creatures that naturally spring up under certain circumstances and proliferate usually with only extremely small, nearly imperceptible movements. Growths cannot be enchanted, and they usually lack a lot of the senses of their type. For example, plants may not be able to see, smell, feel, and have no sense of balance or direction, etc. If a magic user is able to communicate with them, the information received could be extremely limited because the growth may not have taken in much information.

**Humanoids**  
Humanoids are creatures who can socialize. This means they are capable of faction interactions. Non-humanoids can neither defend nor attack using faction actions, and can only be attacked with them if the attack does not involve communicating with the victim. Even creatures capable of understanding words or commands such as dogs cannot be convinced with rhetoric, so a faction attack is limited to commanding the dog to do something simple but harmful, or getting another faction member to harm the dog. Similarly, screaming at a creature may be a faction attack to intimidate or frighten it, but you cannot use a faction ability such as persuasion on a creature such as a wolf. The designation of “humanoid” in no way directs other natural abilities such as speech or bipedalism. If you cannot communicate with another humanoid because of language barriers, you similarly cannot make faction interactions with them. Humanoids are considered to be humanoids and also whatever creature type they are naturally. There are no humanoids that are not another creature type. The humanoid creature type can be used to target any humanoids regardless of their companion creature type.

**Minions**  
Minions are simplified versions of creatures that don’t have the full list of skills and abilities that their more complex counterparts might. You should use minions to populate the general population of your world, such as deer. Minions are only proficient in one skill, and they are always one level below the lowest level of that tier. A wolf in a tier II forest then would most likely be level 6, with a \+6 in encounters, though one or two wolves in a pack will have martial skills instead. The Alpha wolf is probably not a minion, but a complex level 7 or 8 creature. Minions also have one ability related to their skill, which is usually what they are summoned or relied on for.

**Monstrosities**  
Monstrosities are combinations of creatures. Sometimes the combination is from within the same sub-type, such as a griffin which is a bird and lion, both beasts. Sometimes the combination stretches between sub-types such as a mermaid, both a beast and a fish (and also a humanoid), and sometimes it can be between two or more creature types such as a chimera, which is many parts terrestrial and one part draconid.   
Monstrosities can be created through magic intentionally or otherwise, or proliferate naturally. Monstrosities cannot be targeted as a creature type with spells or other abilities, but they are susceptible as members of all of the creature types to which they belong. For example, you cannot target a chimera by confining an attack to “monstrosities” but you can target it as either a terrestrial or a draconid successfully.  
Until the nature of a monstrosity is revealed, targeting the creature by type will be debuffed.  
Monstrosities generally balance their natural abilities between their various creature types, but usually fall prey to a stacking up of weaknesses rather than benefit from a stacking up of strengths. Thus it is not guaranteed that a winged monstrosity can fly, but it is likely that a monstrous terrestiral will lack magical abilities. Monstrosities can be individual humanoids, and monstrous cultures can exist such as snake-people, satyrs, centaurs etc.

**Shapeshifters**  
Shapeshifters are creatures whose natural form allows them to shapeshift into other forms. They have a single natural form, which they often must transform into between transformations, rest in, and revert to when incapacitated, amputated, or dead. Such transformation, though a natural ability, usually takes considerable energy. They have clear tells in all their forms that identify them as shapeshifters, and the shapeshifter category and their natural creature type can be used to target them with spells and abilities, but an assumed creature type cannot. For example, if a shapeshifting dragon appears as a deer, hunting it as a terrestrial will fail because it is a shapeshifter and a dragon, not a terrestrial.  
Shapeshifters can only transform into forms that are of a lower level than their natural form.  
They gain no benefit from transforming back and forth, such as healing or restoring energy. Shapeshifters can only transform into non-shapeshifter creatures that they have seen, or in very rare cases, non-shapeshifter objects they have seen.

**Swarms**  
Swarms are groups of creatures that behave communally. They communicate with one another in an extremely organized and fast way, without individuality. This allows each member of a swarm to act as an appendage to the swarm itself, but they cannot make individual judgements. A swarm is a single creature with multiple manifestations or bodies, such as a school of fish. The swarm behaves fundamentally differently than the individual and will have a different stat block than the individual. A member of a swarm who is not in current communication with the swarm is considered and individual. For this reason, environmental and magical attacks that impact swarm communication can dissolve a swarm without impacting individuals.

# Terrain Types

### Common Environments

These are places that are friendly to human habitation, and so places where humans tend to frequent. You will find them as the core environments of your settings, especially in the early levels. Because they are easy to tame and live in, exploring and crossing them is trivial, low-tier business that many people do.

**Forest** environments are characterized by the complete domination of trees in temperate climates. These trees create a microclimate within a forest, changing the very weather, and are the primary concern of just about every other creature in the forest. The forest floor offers new clues for tracking prey, but may conceal common clues such as footprints. Waterways are often somewhat subject to the forest, being pushed around by fallen trees, and food sources including both plants and animals must live within the trees’ domain. An amateur might think a campfire can go unnoticed in a forest, not realizing that from below you cannot see the smoke signal, but from a few kilometres away it is clear as day. All these hazards must be carefully navagated by those who wish to become masters of the forest.  
A character trained in the forest terrain passes through the terrain of a forest floor as natural movement. They are also naturally capable of climbing trees, poles and other similar surfaces.

**Urban** environments are characterized by the alterations that humanoids have made to the natural setting. Whether they are human cities, kobold warrens or even dense farmland, creatures in an urban environment can hardly escape humanoid architecture. It takes a special mix of skills to make your way in an urban environment. Unlike natural worlds there is most often a great abundance of everything a humaniod might need to prosper, but this abundance is guarded behind norms, laws, social constructs and factions. An excellent urban ranger can find the commonalities between disparate peoples to earn or make their living in any urban centre, and even track people on the trackless cobblestones.  
A character trained in urban terrain can pass through crowds, debris and unusual terrain such as rooftops that would normally constitute reckless movment as their natural movement. They can also climb walls and buildings, and maneuver small gaps, drops, and squeezes such as windows and other barriers caused by urban development.

Whether it is the vast sahel, the steppe or the great prairie, enormous **Grasslands** can stretch for thousands of kilometers and constitute oceans or continents in their own right. It takes a skilled person to find sufficient food in this harsh environment, and often requires hunting large game over many miles. Moving unnoticed in steeply cut creek beds or badlands, and tracking those that do the same also requires a keen eye for life on the grasslands.  
Those trained in grasslands can move great distances with ease. Your natural strategic speed is 10km, the same as a horse. You can also ride one type of mount as natural movement.

Whether they are cold northern bogs or sweltering mangrove forests, Mediterranean reed deltas, or the bayou, **Swamps** represent areas where the ground and fresh water are mixed at the surface. They contain treacherous quicksands and mires and dangerous predators lurking in their shifting landscapes. Staying dry can be a life-or-death struggle as water swells from the skies above and the rising and twisting rivers below, and no assurance can be made that crossing once offers safe passage back. Those trained to move through swamps can swim and move naturally through shallow water, mud, and slippery surfaces.

Along the **Coast**, the land points toward the sea, and the sea points to the land as well. There is a place there, where the streams flow and the waves crash. The coastal environment is both of these places, land and water. The water is whatever is over 1km across, be it the ocean, a sea, a large lake, or even a very wide river. That water is the coast, and so too is the land around it. The interface is famously bountiful. And this bounty draws dangers. Huge sea storms crash onto land. Creatures grown massive from their terrestrial domains come to water. And many creatures live in this liminal place, caught in between.  
Those trained in coastal areas are naturally capable of swimming and wading through water, as well as remaining sure footed on watercraft.

Those unfamiliar with the **Shield** environment might use the word “boulder”, but what about when a rock is over 500m to a side? The shield is characterized first and foremost by granite and the landscape is dominated by the bedrock. This means whatever vegetation grows on tops has little purchase, and prefers the midland areas where dirt and debris has collected to form a thin suitable soil. The lower areas are covered in water, for it cannot drain through the rock, leaving innumerable irregularly shaped waterways which can often not be categorized easily as lakes or rivers. Crossing and recrossing these waterways is necessary, as is scampering over the occasional bare granite cliff. While the shield contains a suitable supply of food and an enormous amount of fresh water, its true bounty is in minerals, where all manner of gems and precious metals can be found in the innumerable granite outcroppings, and massive deposits lie just below the surface or underneath a lake.  
Those trained in the Shield can both climb and swim as natural movement.

### Inhospitable Environments

There are many places on the periphery of civilization that are too rugged for the common folk. They can be crossed with some danger, and small, specialized groups call them home permanently. When designing your world, you can separate areas using these inhospitable environments, then you can build links through them using more favorable terrain. For example, a chain of islands allow the coast to cut through an open ocean, a lush river valley spotted with swamps, grasslands and extensive farms creates a highway through a desert.

The cacophony of wildlife fills the world around the **Desert**, but nothing prepares visitors for the silence, the stillness, the death. Deserts can be filled with sand or rocks, or salt, or any other minerals. They can stretch for thousands of kilometers and offer nothing to those who would attempt to survive among them.  
Those trained to navigate deserts can see naturally in very bright light, and live, and take short rests in heat and cold. They can move naturally over shifting terrain and sand.

The steep cliffs and rugged sides of a **Mountain** break suddenly to reveal jagged peaks, barren slopes and glacier caps. Mountain landscapes can rise out of familiar terrain to reveal an alien world. They can jut out of a tropical jungle to plunge adventurers into snow and ice, or rise to such height that the air thins, the body weakens, and the organs simply fail. You can walk until your legs collapse beneath you, only to find you have crossed little more than a kilometer in a day, and yet a mountain range can stretch for hundreds of kilometers, cutting off otherwise close neighbors.  
Trained mountaineers have developed larger lungs that allow them to breathe naturally in air too thin for others. They can also move across snow, slopes and cliffs as natural movement.

The open **Ocean** is frequently seen as the most dangerous terrain that is naturally found in the world. It is a place wholly alien to humanity. What occurs beyound the misty blue line of the horizon, on a continent of water with towering waves, is beyond the imagination of most. Even there, rain is the only drinkable water, and the fish that are made into food can also present themselves as massive sharks. Whales evade dragons between the waves, so what hope does a land lover have of surviving here?  
Those trained for life on the open ocean can naturally swim. They are also able to rest in open water by floating on their backs, and can find sure footing on watercraft.

The **Jungle** is not like a forest. Where the huge trees modify the terrain and environment of a forest, the trees and plant life constitute a terrain in the jungle. You cannot move without stepping on the massive root structures of trees and pushing through thick vegetation. Frequently, the jungle floor does not see sunlight for years at a time as it is blotted out by the towering, thick canopy. Jungles frequently contain impassable vegitative structures, and the actual topography of travel through the jungle is dictated more by living and fallen trees and other plants than it is by the natural rise and fall of the land. Forests can modify the climate, but jungles can contain microclimates between their canopy and floor unlike what is experienced outside them.  
Those trained in jungle terrain are able to climb and pass over slippery terrain or that obstructed by vegetation as natural movement, and swim.

There are lands in the natural world that plunge below the freezing point of water periodically, but one of the most alien landscapes is the **Frozen** places of the world that only rarely rise to melting temperatures. When they are warmest, these places see snowfall, not rain, and when they are coldest, it’s too cold even to snow. Mammals who live here must seek refuge in huge fat supplies and shelter from the cold. Insects are rare, birds migrate away, and the land is left desolated. Starvation is unlikely only because the sheer cold is almost sure to kill you first. Even in the warm seasons, ice is found on glaciers, on the surface of the water, and a few inches below the ground.  
Those trained in Frozen encounters can take short rests while cold, see in extremely bright and dim light, and pass naturally over slippery terrain and snow.

### The Unseen Worlds

There are places that are not connected by direct geography, but through the ethereal veil that covers the world and permeates it with magical energies. When creating a world you should decide if the unseen worlds constitute whole planes of existence, geographically connected to themselves, or pockets where these strange places exist, or some combination. Also decide whether or not these locations can co-exist. Can an area that experiences a connection with the Feywild also be connected to the Deep? Can one travel from the Primordial realms to Abqaria without passing through the mortal world? Travel to the unseen worlds is also dictated by distinct circumstances, but powerful magic users can forge links to them outside these conditions.

The Land of Genius, the abode of the Muses, the City of Jinn, **Abqaria** is an expansive realm that rests on the state of aloofness and distraction one finds in deep thought, flow or inspiration. It is found when one loses their interest or grip on the mortal world, and so can often be discovered simply by an impassioned and driven seeking of it. Its entire sky is luminous in an even white light, blinding to behold and never dimming. Its inhabitants are elementals that can turn ethereal and fly at will, making doors and passages unnecessary. Though its wilderness is an endless and featureless desert with no food or water, it is spotted with oases of incredible luxury and marvelous works: Kasbahs. These are fortified cities of craftspeople, artists, magicians and inventors that are usually very progressive, and their aloof and fortified nature as well as powerful inhabitants allow them to stand against the covetous mortal factions that would tear them apart to feast on their riches.  
Someone trained in Abqari encounters can move over sand naturally, can rest in hot weather and see through bright light as well as see elementals who have made themselves ethereal.

Beyond the touch of sunlight lies the **Deep**. Whether it is a jungle floor enshrouded in perpetual darkness, a subterranean labyrinth, or the Midnight Zone of the open ocean, the Deep represents all that lies beyond the reach of natural light. There are tales of ancient and treacherous passages under mountains or even under seas, caves with no up or down, even subterranean worlds complete with jungles and intelligent life, and yet, to most, these remain cautionary tales against shunning the light of the sun, not directions to adventure. Transitions into the Deep are dark passages that seem to flicker or disappear in direct lighting.  
Those trained in the Deep can squeeze, climb and move across debris and slippery terrain naturally as well as see in dim light.

The Land of the Fae, Alfheimr, the **Feywild** is the homeland of the fey creature type. It is perpetually dark, with no sun, but a very large and luminous moon as well as frequent auroras that descend from the sky to ground level, thus illuminating it with dim light. The large trees that cover the Feywild use this dim light to grow extremely slowly, creating exotic and extremely dense woods. These forests are populated by fey creatures as well as frequent Terrestrial and Cthonite visitors. Parts of the Feywild are also associated with the afterlife of certain terrestrial humanoids, who rise in the Feywild after they die in the mortal realms. Passages to the Feywild must be dimly lit, usually by twilight or dawn, and they are often found at gates such as standing stones or cairns that physically manifest the passing from the mortal world to elsewhere. These passages can also be naturally occurring places that represent that change, such as the edge of a dark forest or swamp, or the boundary of a thick fog.  
Those trained in the Feywild can see in dim light and pass through vegetation and shallow water naturally. They can also see fey or undead who have attempted to make themselves invisible.

The land of one thousand islands is the sea or perhaps the inverted archipelago of seas that exists in the liminal space called **Manatuana**. Virtually every land near water speaks of a moving island, or an island that rises and falls at certain times of year, or the island to which the spirits of the dead are ushered. These islands all together constitute Manatuana, the plane of liminal islands. Usually these islands have ports between them, and they can be travelled as easily as any other island chain, however each island has only one tether to the mortal world, one condition under which people may travel to and from Manatuana. Perhaps the condition of one island is that it can only be found by the undead, and travelling back takes place on one specific day of the year. Perhaps its neighboring island appears in the eye of a hurricane every June. Perhaps another can be sought out any time of the year, but only found after one has permission from a certain primordial. Whatever the condition of the gate to the mortal realms, it is usually enough to dissuade most travelers and earn the skepticism of the rest.  
Those trained in Manatuana can naturally move on water vessels and can swim.

Some say the world was once roamed only by primoridals, and that they created **Primordial Realms** for one another that now constitute various other environments. But sometimes, in places widely understood as sacred, a path will open to reveal a realm untouched by all that has transpired since this ancient time. If this primordial land’s guardian is peaceful, such a bountiful garden can seem to be a sublime Eden, and sometimes humanoids contrive a fate such that they will rise undead in these beautiful places once they die. If, on the other hand, this realm’s sovereign is wrathful, a profound darkness seeps from this wound and contaminates the neighboring realms, and the primordial environment itself is a wasteland of polluted land, water and air, and its creatures are wretched abominations.  
Those trained to walk primordial realms are natural acrobats who can leap, swing, and climb as natural movement. They can also naturally recognize a primordial who has shapeshifted or otherwise taken a more mundane form.

# Glossary

**Ability \[Play|Spell|Asset|Strategy\]**  
Abilities are discrete actions a creature can perform, sometimes with an associated energy, supply or social credit cost that have a mechanical effect.  
Natural Abilities are abilities that are granted by virtue of a creature's basic nature and physical characteristics.  
Background Abilities are abilities that are granted by virtue of a character’s background.  
Each Arena of Play uses a particular word to describe its abilities, however they are functionally identical within the idicyncracies of their arena of play. Plays are Martial Abilities, Spells are Magic Abilities, Assets are Faction Abilities and Strategies are Recon Abilities.

**Arena of Play**  
A mode of understanding actions in a mechanical context as being either martial, magical, faction or recon based.

**Breakthrough**  
A result that is more than 5 points above the difficulty, indicating an unqualified success or major shift in outcomes as dictated by the narrative.

**Buff \[Debuff\]**  
Take the higher of the two dice rolled. You can do this by expending energy for physical and magical actions, social credit for faction actions, and various other methods found elsewhere. Having multiple reasons to be buffed has no effect.  
Debuff is to prevent the higher die from being taken. Debuffs always overcome any number of buffs, so if there are 3 reasons a creature is buffed and only one reason it is debuffed, it takes the lower die.

**Challenge \[Fate Challenge\]**

A challenge is a series of checks set out to accomplish a narrative goal that has both a success and fail state, and uncertainty of either.

A fate challenge, usually the culmination of a series of other challenges, is a challenge that a player would like to use to challenge their character’s fate. The success state is tied to the character levelling up, and the fail state indicates that the character is permanently retired or dies.

**Character**  
A Character is a Humanoid with a Personality.

**Check \[Skill Check | Save\]**  
A check is a roll to test the consequences of an action. If the result of failure would impose a condition on the one executing the action, it is called a save.

**Conditions \[Minor and Critical\]**  
Conditions are afflictions that alter how a character can access their abilities, skills, proficiencies, buffs and other features.  
Minor conditions can reduce access to or effectiveness of some skills and abilities. Critical conditions reduce the character to a barely playable state.  
Unless otherwise stated, conditions can be relieved over the course of a long rest.Temporary conditions end at the end of a challenge. Permanent conditions cannot be overcome in a long rest and require a narrative solution (quest).

**Consequence**  
The narrative effect that takes place because of a check or save, which often has a mechanical component as well.

**Creature**  
A creature is an object, composite or swarm with an intrinsic ability to act upon the world.

**Damage**  
The number result of a check or save where the consequence is the application of a condition.

**Difficulty \[Base\]**  
The defense number for a check against an inanimate object, geography, etc. The difficulty operates identically to the passive defense of a creature in that a check is compared against it to determine a consequence of an action.  
Base Difficulty of a region, faction or locale is the assumed difficulty to take any unsure action regarding that geography or polity, for example to cross a river or find a market.  
The GM never arbitrates difficulties, they are based on the base difficulty, a stated creature’s passive skills, or on the party level \+5.

**Encounter**  
The meeting of two or more parties in a locale where they can sense eachother and interact meaningfully. Often intentionally contrived narratively or through an initiative check.

**Energy \[Max\]**  
The stored biochemical energy you can exert to undertake exceptional actions, including buffing actions, casting spells and using martial plays.  
A human’s max energy starts at 2 and can be increased by 1 by using a levelling point, representing increased overall fitness and efficiency at their usual actions.

**Ethereal**   
Anything without substantive physical form, such as smoke, mist, or arcane ether. Ethereal things have a location in the physical world, but they can share their space with any number of other ethereal things or any number of physical things that also fit in that space. They can move through most materials except iron, lead and certain other materials you designate for your setting, though most materials would be considered difficult terrain. Only those materials they cannot cross can be used to physically harm ethereal creatures or objects. Ethereal things are not necessarily invisible, nor are they necessarily visible. Their default visibility depends on the nature of their etherealness. Ethereal creatures cannot be tracked using terrain type, since they do not interact with terrain very much. They can still be tracked using their creature type or locality. Ethereal creatures cannot interact with physical objects, including iron or lead.

**Graduated Check**  
The repetition of a nearly identical check, which therefore takes place over the next higher time scale. For example, a check to open a door as an action can be re-taken using identical methods, characters and tools, but it will then be taken as a minute-long check. It could again be re-taken but as a ten-minute long check, etc.

**Humanoid**  
A Creature that is capable of communicating and understanding communication, forming and understanding complex social bonds, and therefore acting in and being subject to the factions arena of play. The exact definition can be elusive, but you could consider whether or not a creature would be reasonably capable of articulating the Prisoners’ Dilemma as a benchmark. Not all creatures that can communicate are humanoids. It does not refer to their silhouette or physical characteristics in any way.

**Locale**  
An area, usually less than 300m to a side, that represents a discrete tactical unit. It cannot easily be entered or exited or circumvented, has defined edges and an identity such as “the bowling alley” or “around the pond”. It can therefore be targeted by checks such as initiative, investigations and some spells, and it is the unit by which initiative usually sets up and tactical challenges are undertaken.

**Points \[Intel | Initiative\]**  
The numeric result of an intel or initiative check, usually used to establish the number of data points or preparatory actions available as a consequence of each check respectively.

**Proficiency \[Bonus\]**  
The knowledge of how to do something and practice of being able to do it, expressed mechanically by adding your proficiency bonus (equal to your level) to a roll to come out with a result.

**Rest \[Short|Long\]**  
A period in which a character engages in physical and mental recovery, often reclining, relaxing, eating, sleeping, socializing and engaging in their downtime activity. In order to rest, a creature must be in an environment that they can naturally survive indefinitely, including an appropriate temperature and moisture, the ability to change positions, etc.  
A short rest takes one hour and consumes one ration, and allows the creature to recover energy up to half its maximum energy, so if its maximum is 6, it can only regain energy to come up to 3\.  
A long rest takes 8 hours, and requires the creature to consume one ration and have access to water for washing and drinking, and for the creature to fall asleep. At the end of a long rest, a creature restores all its energy and social credit, and can either eliminate a minor condition or reduce a critical condition to its minor form.

**Result**  
The Result of a check or roll is the numerical value of the chosen die plus proficiency. For example, if you roll 2 and 7 and have a proficiency of \+6, your result is 8 unless you buff the roll, in which case it is 15\.

**Roll**  
The numbers that appear on the dice when they are rolled such as 8-11 or 2-7.

**Sense \[Primary\]**  
The ability that a creature uses to perceive the world. All creatures have a primary sense, which is specifically defined if it is not equivalent to human vision. The primary use of a sense is to designate targets, so a creature must be obscured from its opponents primary sense to avoid being targeted. A creature can use non-primary senses to try to designate targets, but does so within the limits of that sense and without proficiency.

**Social Credit \[Max\]**  
Some combination of your charisma, wealth, family background, fame, and the myriad other things that guide peoples’ perception of you and your ability to get people to do what you want.  
Humans start with 1 max social credit and can add additional social credit by using  levelling points, representing their increased fame, wealth, knowledge, or skill in social circles.

**Supply**  
Stuff you have. It remains undefined until such a time as you need to use it for something, at which time it takes on a form that is narratively plausible based on your surroundings, character, skills, packs or other narrative reasoning.

**Target**  
Many abilities, especially spells, require you to target a creature, object or location. You must be able to sense targets using your creature’s natural primary sense. For most characters this means you must be able to see them. Creatures that are hidden are presumed to be hidden from this sense, no matter what it is, meaning they cannot be targeted.  
Humans’ primary sense is sight, but we also have considerable spatial sense. For that reason, humans can target such creatures as “the creature beneath the blanket” or “the figure in the dark,” even if their exact nature is obscured, we can see enough of them to put their body together spatially. In total darkness, humans cannot target creatures even if they can feel or hear them. As long as you can use your primary sense to sense them, you can target them. This means humans can target through mirrors or remote viewing. Other creatures such as dogs would use their own primary sense, smell, to the same effect. If you are aware of the primary sense of a creature, you can make an ordinary encounter check to hide from their primary sense and prevent them from targeting you.

**Time \[Tactical | Strategic\]**  
Tactical time takes place in discrete rounds, with each opposing side taking one turn each round to undertake their tactical maneuvers and actions. Overall, tactical challenges usually take less than one minute, with each round representing a few seconds. Tactical challenges usually address tactically relevant uncertainties, for example rushing to get onto a train that is currently departing. Generally, martial actions are tactical (take a few seconds) unless otherwise stated or narratively obvious.  
Strategic time takes longer. The intervals are one hour, in which time all parties simultaneously conduct their strategic actions. If there is an uncertainty when it comes to which such actions take place first, the answer is usually resolved tactically. For example, if two parties are trying to get to a nearby town, a tactical challenge to board the train may determine which party arrives minutes before the other. Generally, Faction and Recon checks are strategic (take one hour) unless otherwise stated or narratively obvious.
