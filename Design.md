## Building Sessions and Campaigns, The Section that is Actually for the GMs

### The Simple Summary

You can read the next sections to get into the deeper theory, but here’s the sum of it:

* The GM never arbitrates higher or lower difficulties to represent easier or harder challenges or more dangerous creatures.  
* Number of required checks is the measure of difficulty, set above and below the sum of character levels.  
* Number of economic units that the opposition uses per long rest should always equal the sum of character levels in the party.  
* The GM tracks progression of the party through the session and campaign, using creatures, factions and geographies as the appendages of their own fates.

### Base Difficulty.

The GM never arbitrates higher base difficulties or skill bonuses to artificially create a more difficult situation. The mathematical reasoning for this is complex, but effectively, it doesn’t work. Consider the extremes to get a general idea of the problem: with a \+1, a level 1 character has a 0% chance of ever having a result above 13\. If you artificially bulk a creature’s passive martial skill to 8, that means your level 1 character could never harm that target. This is part of the Tiers of Play, Folk Fantasy, and Fate core tenets of the game. A level 1 character should not, in fact, be put in a situation where they are meant to do harm to a level 8 opponent. While they could theoretically of course simply shoot them, the contraventions of fate and the basic premise of non-heroism prevent it in the game. For a character to get into a situation where they would face down that level 8 creature, they need to challenge their status; they need to change their fate (to level up a few times first).  
In order to do that, characters always face obstacles that are on their level. It can be assumed that obstacles that are in line with their station and fate are always the same level that they are. Fighting lower level monsters is not rewarding, fighting higher level monsters is just pride taking a run at you.

### So how do GMs control difficulty in Round Table?

So what does it take to disable a level 1 minion? One action. Any action really, it could be a spell, a convincing argument, a well placed punch, or sneaking around them. If the party is clever, they will figure out the arena that the minion uses, and counter it in an intelligent way. The key is that if the opponent and challenges match the party’s level (give or take 1 level), each challenge will jeopardize a type of game currency: Social Credit, Energy, or Supply. These currencies are made interchangeable by the game’s mechanics, which means the basic economic unit of the game is the Long Rest, where Social Credit and Energy are restored completely, and many abilities refresh to allow them to be exchanged once again. The Long Rest represents the Supply side of the economy of challenge difficulty. In a long rest for a starter party, 2-3 units per character are restored.   
The game is automatically balanced such that any same-level challenge faced by the party statistically presents the party with the choice of two dice: one above the challenge difficulty and one below. This means, in order to succeed at any given challenge, the party must expend 1e per roll. The dice are fickle, sometimes you roll under twice or above twice, but as long as you keep rolling, the statistics will allow for the ebb and flow of luck while maintaining a general sense of challenge.  
In practice, rolling fewer than 8 times per long rest is statistically insignificant for a table. There are not enough iterations of the economy simulation to get a predictable result. That’s why your typical party starts with 4 level 1 characters: 8 energy.  
They also have Supply and Social Credit, which is the key feature of player agency in the game. Your party must diversify and swap their resources to succeed.  
As the party increases in level, you add additional challenges per long rest to reflect 6-10 additional rolls. The GM (and to a lesser extent the table as a whole) should also keep a general idea of the entire party’s economy, increasing risks or rewards appropriately.  
Remember: because the in-game currencies are interchangeable mathematically, you only need to deplete any one of them, and allow the party to figure out how to exchange them. For example if it takes one energy to succeed at climbing a cliff, and the risk is that you drop some gear and lose 1 supply, you don’t need to do anything to balance the game. The challenge automatically expends one economic unit from the party whether they succeed or fail. But they still have plenty of agency to use other abilities or methods to circumvent the challenge. In this way, the GM doesn’t have to overthink anything, or rebalance after a breakthrough or loss from the party. Just keep going. You just need to reach statistical balance.  
Example:  
You know that just gaining control of a grapple requires one economic unit, whether they roll it, do magic, use an item, sneak, etc. They will statistically spend one economic unit. You start an encounter by having an opponent physically grab one of the players. Now they are in a clinch. The party has already spent something. The purpose of the clinch is so that another opponent can try to steal 1 supply from the party. Now they have spent two economic units. No matter what they do to overcome the theft, they statistically spend something to do it. A third opponent is trying to distract the party while this is happening. That’s 3\. Any time anyone is rolling the dice, statistically they will buff that roll with something. In this example, in a single round, over the course of seconds, a level 1 party has jeopardized half their available resources for the day. If you leave it there, and call that a day, it is entirely up to the dice whether or not the party succeeds or fails. They can buff every roll, knowing there are no consequences because they will never run out of energy.   
You must run a number of challenges that make the outcome statistically unlikely to succeed in order to give your players the agency to make the decisions needed to achieve their goals, otherwise they are not agents in their own success.

### Opponent Economy

The party has an economy based on the sum of their supply, energy and Social Credit. Their opponents also have access to supply, energy and social credit, however it would be impossible and ultimately futile to track it for each opponent. Instead, the relevant question is how many resources are the sum of the opponents willing and able to level against the party? As an example, an unknown group of rowdy adventurers making noise in a bar might not merit expending even one energy or social credit to attempt to quiet them down, even if an opposing creature has those resources in reserve. So the GM is left with a number of resources that the sum of opponents are *willing* to expend before they basically just let the party get away with something. Keep in mind, every creature and every faction is living an entire life in Round Table. Precisely because the world does not revolve around the party, opponents are quick to retreat, unwilling to expend resources against them, and perhaps already in a deficit because of some unexplained occurrence before the party showed up.  
When you set out a campaign, plan for a number of resources equal to the sum of levels of all party members to be expended between each of the party’s long rests. It’s simplified but effective. If you find that your party is looking for more of a challenge, increase the number. If they are wanting a cozier game, reduce it. Whenever an opponent buffs a roll or uses an ability that requires energy, social credit or supply, deduct it from the total opponent resources.  
There are two explanations for Opponent Economy within Round Table. The first is that the party is travelling along their fate trajectory, and fate has something in store for them. The subtle ebb and flow of the Veil of magic that surrounds the world empowers creatures to expend resources against the party, or holds them back. A number of such resources is expended along the way that is governed by forces beyond the ken of those creatures and factions which expend them. The second explanation, and the one which the party should encounter, is the explanation that people give in support of this “greater plan”. They are tired, sick, in a bad mood, just plain don’t like the cut of the party’s jibb. Everyone has a reason for everything that is tied into their regular daily lives, only a few notice the pattern from one challenge to the next.

### Designing Sessions

Sessions are the basic unit of play, they are the meeting in which the players play the game. They should ideally follow a structure to be engaging and reduce the amount of floating data points that need to be picked up at a later session, tying everything into a neat bow to be re-opened at a later date, but pulling this off is difficult. Sessions are best designed if they are focused on a single item that moves the plot forward. Sessions can be based around any focus point, but here are some places to start:

* A travel montage  
* Exploring a new faction  
* Exploring a locale in depth  
* Finding information for next steps  
* A character’s fate challenge  
* Introduction of a key NPC  
* Moving a player’s plot forward  
* Establishing a new region  
* Exploring a specific game mechanic  
* Exploring a philosophical question  
* Recovering from a permanent injury

To design a session, look to your overall adventure plan, and cut out a concise piece that includes a number of different challenges, sometimes as few as 1 or 2 is sufficient. Consider how much time you have to play, how many players there are, what you are trying to accomplish, how often your table gets side-tracked.

### Adventures

Adventures are a series of sessions planned out to achieve a specific goal within a broader setting and with room for everyone to contribute and explore. Importantly, they can be understood as the unit between long rests, which is key to planning. They are often broadly based on similar premises as sessions and can be as short as one session, but with a more general approach. For example, an adventure to travel across several regions may include many sessions dealing with exploration, travel and the associated obstacles, not to mention character development and fate challenges. Adventures are usually the unit that individual characters play along, starting new at the beginning of the adventure and dying or retiring as their end. Adventures may be built around any of the following:

* Levelling the entire party up  
* Exploring the interplay of various regions and factions in the setting  
* Developing changes to the setting  
* Very long distance travel  
* The establishment of a new faction and its repercussions  
* Acquiring a legendary treasure

To design an adventure, develop a conceit for why your party cannot take a long rest during the adventure segment, for example planning for the removal of accommodations or the introduction of creatures attempting to ambush them. The simplest reason is that the events take place within an 8 hour time span. Next, split the adventure up into a number of checks equal to the total number of levels in the party. You can collect these checks into complex challenges, for example using 2-3 checks to climb a difficult cliff face, or facing 4 opponents of the same level (8 checks). Lay these checks out narratively, considering fail states, but not worrying too much about work-arounds. For example, make sure you know the consequences of failing the checks when climbing the cliff, but don’t worry too much about the party finding another way around the cliff (just do 3 checks when they do that). Make sure the checks are interesting things that your party likes to do, challenges them, hasn’t done before, takes advantage of some new equipment, etc.  
You can lay out your adventure in a checklist, if that helps. Then just try to walk the party along their fate and see how hard it is to herd cats. For this reason, you should use stated interests and motivations of your players as the core plotline.

### Campaigns

Campaigns are years-long series of adventures that come together to thoroughly develop many characters per player, many regions and factions, and everything in between. Campaigns often explore world-changing events and their effects on the people of a setting, or themes of certain philosophical questions like the nature of humanity. Campaigns are generally not built around player characters, and players are encouraged to change characters and roles regularly. You can start designing a campaign by putting together one or two adventure ideas, but they should emerge organically one adventure at a time from your table.

## The Design Section, Which is not Only for GMs

### Designing at a Round Table

Round Table games are designed by the Table, not by the GM. We would be honoured to be invited to your table to contribute official content to help guide your game and provide you tools. Along with this rule book and official content, the GMs role is to facilitate play by designing and managing content, not necessarily arbitrating on rules. Players can take on lots of different roles, but the most common way to interact with the game is as a character player.   
Your character doesn’t end abruptly within an individual identity. A person is the sum of the people who make them. All players are encouraged to establish and integrate deep links between their characters and the world including factions, locales and other setting lore that is important to them. Many rules do not need to be arbitrated by the GM, but can be proposed and run by the player themselves. If you are familiar enough with the rules, for example, you can propose and play through an entire challenge with your other players, the GM is meant to chime in to help play run smoothly, voice and play adversarial roles, and manage the content that is accessed and established by the players.  
Be sure to meet new players at their level. Youths might need help with math and organization. Those new to RPGs might need help with getting into character and playing the role instead of the numbers. Those new to tabletops might need help interpreting desires and actions as mechanics. Those new to Round Table might need help with collaboratively taking the reins when establishing setting elements and outcomes.

### Designing Folk Fantasy

Round Table games are about ordinary people facing challenges in a fantastic setting. To achieve this aesthetic, it’s important to consider the overall setting before deciding how individual characters fit into it. Society and factions are paramount, and obstacles are almost always the result of a lack of consideration for the players characters, rather than in opposition to them. For example, the appearance of an evil magician seeking to ennsslave the players’ characters’ families is a call to heroics. In Round Table you can instead create a similar danger by introducing a powerful drake, simply looking to eat, unconcerned with the fact that it is trying to eat player characters. Not every single obstacle or conflict is centred on mindless beasts and the environment, but society and individuals are often just as callous.  
It may not be for everyone, but the question asked in Round Table is not “what if I could fly” but rather more subtly, “what if I could achieve my goals without flying?” Instead of super-powered characters fighting super-powered monsters, folk fantasy imagines a world where you don’t need to be a mythical hero to achieve basic justice in an unforgiving world, you just need eachother.

### Table Rules to Adjust the Tone and Difficulty

You can add a number of table rules to adjust the tone of the game and the difficulty.   
Tone is the overall sensation of playing the game, including table culture, characters, plotlines, etc. Some rules can be adjusted to enhance this aspect of gameplay while also relying on communicating the expectations and desires of the players to achieve a certain tone.  
You can achieve a more **Grim** tone by making permanent injuries more common, focusing on Cthonite creatures and cynical cults, making the fey alien and unknowable creatures of twilight, make use of undead often, and use the indifferent relation more frequently for the general public, as well as increasing the overall difficulty.  
You can dip into **Horror** by making permanent injuries and possession more common, and making use of enchantments, corporeal undead, revenant constructs, and Cthonites. Rely on sudden ambushes, jump-scares and use martial and magic attacks to cause merciless critical injuries with no warning, especially from creatures well suited to hiding.  
A **Post-Apocalyptic** game can focus on inventory management, making supply scarce and balancing the game between faction dynamics with other survivors and recon dynamics to find resources and avoid whatever caused the apocalypse. Constantly run supply levels down to prevent long rests, then use waves of attacks from both creatures and other survivors.  
A **high-fantasy** feel might focus on humanoids of other creature types like Jinn and Elves, with very powerful non-humanoid draconids and other monsters carving out large, wild lands between highly developed urban centres. Bestow quests directly to the party from faction authorities like sheriffs or knights to travel to distant lands or defeat creatures menacing the borders of the wildlands.  
Your game can focus on **Intrigue** by formulating complex networks of individuals operating within factions to try to achieve goals in a setting where both magic and martial violence are heavily restricted.  
You can create a **Bottle Episode** by restricting an entire session or short adventure to a single locale, such as a ship, island, moving train, etc.  
You can create a **Cozy** game experience by focusing on helping factions succeed and cooperate with eachother, restore members to good standing, and find resources with an emphasis on exploration of the natural world and social structures through elaborate descriptions.  
Your game will become more **Zany** if you increase the frequency of temporary injuries, are more permissive with faction expectations and relations, and focus on memes and jokes such as character mash-ups, pop-culture references.

Difficulty is meant to describe the level of expertise required from the players to achieve their fate challenges and general play, and is therefore mostly a function of how many resources need to be used on average per challenge. Increasing difficulty may have the effect of making a game more granular or serious in tone as well.

* Increase difficulty by allowing players to engage in extensive side-bars and distractions without providing resources or bringing them back to the plot.  
* Decrease difficulty by allowing players to take a 12 whenever it appears, without having to buff their roll.  
* Increase difficulty by taxiing the party through equipment loss or failure whenever they keep a 1, regardless of the result of the roll.  
* Decrease difficulty by allowing players to sum doubles as their total roll (so if they roll 8-8, it is as if they rolled 16).  
* Increase difficulty by hounding the party with permanent injuries and hostile individuals and factions, requiring extensive side-bars to rectify these situations without bonus resources.  
* Decrease difficulty by providing loot drops in the form of supply and items frequently.  
* Increase difficulty by setting more strict requirements for resting, such as 12 or even 24 hour time requirements for long rests, cooking food, etc.

### Roles

Players should not strictly fall into any one role in Round Table but rather should take on whatever needs to be done in accordance with their ability. A great voice actor doesn’t need to restrict themselves to only voicing their character. Someone who knows the rules well should clarify them for everyone. Someone who loves inventory management could manage the entire party’s inventory all the time. What follows are a few guidelines to provide tools for tables to run effectively and fit into the culture of Round Table play.

#### Character Players

Character players are the only absolutely necessary role in Round Table. Each one usually manages one character, who is not strictly limited to the individual but also includes background connections to the setting such as locales and factions that are integral to the character. They may also manage affiliated characters like minions, character assets, family members, etc. The key is that a character player has a deep and setting-informed understanding of the character, allowing for interesting interactions and deep role play.

#### Game Manager

The game manager is not an arbitrator on the rules, but rather a facilitator. The game manager uses brief information from the players about their characters and associated  setting elements, as well as the players’ stated goals for the game to design compelling adventures and campaigns. You don’t necessarily need a GM in order to play an individual session, especially if the majority of the design work is already laid out by official content or the context of the larger campaign, GMs are there to create and maintain consistent and compelling setting for characters to explore and grow.

#### Faction Manager

You may have one player, especially who is less familiar with the rules or more interested in narrative and intrigue, run the factions of a setting or run an individual faction instead of a single character.

#### Adventure/Session Manager

Having a player drop in to manage an individual setting or adventure within a larger campaign is a great way to introduce players to GMing, or even introduce new players to the game as a whole. Because the role of GM is focused on managing the overall flow of the game, players themselves can usually step in to clarify individual mechanics and rules, allowing the session manager to focus on understanding how it all fits together.

## Design Section of Various Elements of Round Table Games

### Designing Backgrounds

Backgrounds should be integrated deeply into your setting, reflecting diverse cultural experiences even within the same culture and should not be used to stereotype. They are profound identity markers that should fit into your setting and give it depth, helping to make each character unique.  
Backgrounds give options and suggestions for personality traits such as appearance, auditory cue and downtime activities. They describe a paradigm and what characters perceive as normal.  
A background will feature a unique ability, adapted from one of the abilities found in the four arenas of play that gives a moderate mechanical nuance to the way a character with that background is used to interacting with the world. It is often a slightly more specific version of another ability, but should not be made redundant by a character also having a related skill.  
Lastly, a background includes 5 additional abilities, usually copied directly from those found in the other arenas. This gives each character access to a few abilities outside their arena of play by virtue of relying on their upbringing that must be unlocked with levelling points.

### Designing Skills

When designing skills, never design them for a character. You can use a character inspiration as an archetype, but the skill is a tradition of hundreds or thousands of people and should be designed to fit a setting, not to provide for an individual. Consider using your own real-life knowledge and context to design a profound and thoughtful skill based around your own special knowledge and interests.  
When designing skills, keep in mind that they should open up access to the entire arena of play, so don’t design them to be so niche or singular that they narrow a character’s scope, but rather that they provide a unique perspective and set of abilities to provide that character with greater access to the world.  
Sometimes it can be difficult to squeeze a concept rigidly into a single arena of play. Perhaps the idea can be broken across two different skills that are working together to provide the broad scope you are imagining, and either of those skills could theoretically also be taken with other skills to end up with a totally new concept. A Pirate, for example could be any mix of a Brigand (Martial), a Sea Witch (Magic), a Privateer (Factions) and a Sailor (Recon), and just using these four skills, there are six possible combinations that all can be found on a pirate ship.  
You may find that exchanging one proficiency in your skill description for that of another skill description can also do a lot to diversify and resolve your skill concept. These Crossover Proficiencies should be limited to a single example in each skill, for example a Mage Hunter Martial class dipping in to a single Minor Arcanum instead of a sport to protect themselves from their preferred foe.

##### Martial

Martial traditions are centred around the body, movement, fitness, and violence. They must justify violence within a context, sometimes one that is quite arcane and confusing to outsiders, sometimes one as simple as “violence is acceptable to use against all those that the leadership declares that violence is acceptable to use against.” This rarely limits them, of course, usually the justification for violence is applied post-hoc, or consent is manufactured beforehand, both processes better left to Faction leaders.  
Martial skills consist of **Proficiencies** that include: 

* One category of tools or weapons such as swords.  
* Another way to do violence, which might include an additional category of weapons.  
* A type of movement in the tactical arena, such as climbing or squeezing.  
* A sport or area of knowledge.

Remind users that they can always add any Martial Plays as abilities by using one levelling point.

##### Magic

Magic Traditions are very diverse, and can have a profound impact on your setting in general. They should make some attempt to justify and detail the use of magic, including moral, philosophical principles behind its use, where it comes from, and why the tradition’s use of magic is particularly acceptable. Additionally, magic traditions confer one each of the following benefits:

* A way to manipulate their spells by changing one characteristic and adding 1e to the casting cost. You can either allow any characteristic to be changed for a restricted school of magic or target creature type, or you can allow any school or target type, but only one category of characteristic can be changed. **Either you can change any part of an Enchantment, or you can change only the range of any type of spell, as two examples.** In the case of Major Arcanum, you must only learn the spell in its altered form, in the case of minor arcanum, scrolls, etc, you can alter them on the fly.  
* A category of Magic tools as found in Chapter 3 such as wands/rods/staffs.  
* A Minor Arcanum as found in Chapter 3\.

Be sure to remind users that your magic tradition allows them to learn any Minor or Major Arcanum that they come across by using a levelling point.

##### Factions

Faction skills are the skills used by individuals to take advantage of faction assets and collective power. They are very strongly culturally informed, and usually suit certain regions and their factions. Taken totally out of context, the individuals retain their overall skills in diplomacy and charisma, but without the support of the social structures that they have built these skills upon. For example, the concept of observing etiquette is somewhat universal, but the particulars of dining etiquette vary greatly. Therefore a master of tea ceremonies may have a great impact across a number of different factions, but they also have a sense for reading people and inducing calm diplomacy that transcends the specifics of their training. Faction skills confer the following benefits:

* An Additional Language, dialect, slang, jargon, cant, code, sign language or artistic expression that is particular to their culture or a specific faction.  
* An Interpersonal Interaction that allows them to generate leverage with members of specific factions for free.  
* A Social Art that they can perform during long rests that allow them to take some specified free action while also benefiting from the long rest.

Include a reminder that Factions skills allow any character to take on a quest to try to add an Asset to the faction, or to use levelling points to acquire a Personal Asset for themselves.

##### Recon

Recon skills aside from the generic ones already offered in the appendix are exclusively related to Regions. They represent a profound connection to that region and the land in general, and often carry characteristics of the land as well. Recon Region Skills always include proficiency in movement, checks and saves while in the region in question, and confer two out of the following proficiencies:

* A pack and related equipment particular to the Region and the ability to convert supply to certain items without a pack.  
* A Generalized method of movement, terrain type proficiency, or creature type proficiency that applies outside the region.  
* Proficiency with a class of mount or vehicle that is emblematic of the region.

### Designing Creatures

Creatures are usually not humanoids, as humanoids are capable of complex social interactions and communication, they are usually characters instead.  
Set out the creature inspiration and purpose in the setting or adventure. Be sure to tie it in narratively to the world at large and establish its level.  
Establish its natural abilities including movement methods and speeds and its primary sense. Use official content references for similar creatures’ natural abilities.  
Creatures usually occupy two arenas of play with the creature’s natural form being its skills. Sometimes different types, species or versions might exist with different skills.  
Describe the proficiencies that the creature naturally has, including any natural weapons and resistances.  
Using double the creature’s level, distribute levelling points in the form of additional max energy and abilities from whichever arenas of play it would naturally occupy or abilities found in similar official content creatures.

### Designing Characters

Non-Player Characters are designed in the same manner that Player-characters are.  
Start with a Personality, including visual information, auditory cue, downtime activity, etc. Work through their skills, equipment, relations, or anything else that is relevant to the party. Feel free to drop in appropriate existing characters from official or table content that have not been used yet.

### Designing Factions

Factions consist of dozens or hundreds of people organized in a way that a character might be a member. They could be families, political parties, clubs, unions, guilds, secret societies, corporations, ministries, cults, or any other self-identified organization of people with any number of stated, implied, or secretive goals and rules. They have specific relationships with other factions that they commonly interact with and may also encourage or restrict access to other skills.  
Define your faction, how it acquires and controls membership, and its tier of play. A lower-tier faction will operate in a geographically smaller area, whereas a higher-tier one will occupy a geographically larger area. Social constructs like countries and nations may also create super-structures of factions that tend to not occupy territories across national borders, so a series of lower-tier and mid-tier factions may occupy two distinct zones that represent two different countries. Your library card doesn’t work in another country.  
Define your faction’s history, relationships with other important factions, and what its operative locales look and feel like. Add a market, and a few characters and locales just in case it gets explored in detail.

### Designing Markets

Designing markets is very straightforward, but also very tedious, and is actually the design element that is probably most advanced and requires the most judgement and finesse.   
You should simply take an existing market document, this could be a magazine, catalogue, historical research paper, historical pricing decree, list of things you find in a thrift store, etc. and figure out the typical, day’s wages within the context of that market. Now this idea of “typical day’s wages” is a very arcane concept that even academics struggle with, so just make a reasonable guess using the average, median, or some stated wage in context. The fact that you will be off is actually fine because it will alter the price point for your whole market, which is good. Next, using the average day’s wage as a GP indicator, convert all the prices to GP, rounding to the nearest 1/10.  
Lastly, for items that should include stats, caveats, restrictions, etc, include them in the descriptions of those items. This likely includes conveying magical properties to real world or historical items that do not have magical properties, so your judgement and discretion makes a huge difference.

### Designing Locales

Locales are unique places with special characteristics. The key feature of locales is that they are limited to spaces that are less than 300m, and are therefore tactical spaces that can be traversed in less than a minute and shot across with a bow or gun.  
First, figure out what the reason for establishing the locale is, and be sure it serves that purpose. It should be well suited to its region, or a few regions, and may be linked to a faction or creature as well.  
Next, you might decide that the locale has a special feature of some variety. It might be a type of terrain or obstacle that is typical of the locale, or a buff that it gives to certain skills. You can tie in markets, characters, and many other components of the locale to integrate it into the setting and ensure that it feels like it has a purpose beyond whatever the party needs from it at any given time and design a map, street view, or other art to help deliver the sense of the locale.

### Designing Regions

Regions are vast areas, hundreds or even thousands of kilometers to a side that present a contiguous, though not uniform geography. They are not general geographies like “mountains”, they are specific, even within an area that is otherwise similar geographically. For example, the Antarctic is not a good basis for a region. Instead, dozens of regions can be pulled out of its extremely varied geography from ice shelves to coastlines to mountains, to lakes shrouded in darkness beneath glaciers.   
Once you have sized your region appropriately and decided on the overall terrain type, include a short list of possible creatures, locales and factions that operate in the region and the corresponding Recon skill for the region. Define the major settlements and the roads between them to allow for calculations on travel. Make sure to at least consider the neighboring regions, and their influence in each sphere, including economy, ecology, facftions, etc, as well as the regional ties to the Unseen Worlds.
