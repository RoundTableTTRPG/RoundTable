# **Chapter 4 :** The “Factions” Arena of Play Dealing with Interpersonal, Group and Societal Dynamics

Those skilled with the arts of diplomacy will use their faction skills and the assets of their allied factions to make a difference in their daily activities. Faction characters use hour-long strategic actions to wrangle support, investigate, or even attack enemies through the complicated spider web of faction relations.  
Unlike martial skills, which focus on the tactical realm and physical movement, faction skills rely on negotiation, intimidation, investigation and persuasion, but none of that matters if you don’t know who you’re dealing with, or they don’t know to be afraid of you. 

### Faction Checks

Faction checks operate just like checks from the other 3 arenas, and like checks from those other arenas, they have some idiosyncrasies. Like the other arenas, you need to be able to target a creature to make a faction check against them. In the case of faction checks you must also be able to communicate with them. You roll 2d12, and subtract your opponent’s passive or active defense, applying buffs or debuffs as necessary. The result can be applied as damage incurring a social condition, initiative points when establishing an encounter, intel points, success or failure, or any other result relevant to the particular challenge you are facing.

### Social Credit

In addition to supply and GP, there is a currency specific to the Factions arena of play that can be converted to leverage, assets, and the other currencies. Social Credit represents your overall charisma, social graces, inherited place in society, and legendary status. No one of these things completely trumps the other, and a beautiful or eloquent person may be taken more seriously than a high-ranking official. The specifics of how any individual character derives their Social Credit is up to their player, but mechanically you can use one levelling point to permanently acquire one additional maximum Social Credit that may represent your increasing cunning, renown, gravitas, or whatever you like. Social Credit is regained to your maximum after completing a long rest.

### Personal Assets

In addition to faction assets detailed below and in official content, an individual might buy, inherit, win or otherwise acquire a personal asset. This is a major item such as an estate or dedicated followers that is not tied to a faction and can be accessed by the individual at any time. To acquire a personal asset, the character must go through the acquisition challenge detailed below, however the cost of the asset in addition to the GP cost is one levelling point. The asset both costs and represents an achievement in faction skills in the sense that it is a considerable personal fortune. In many cases, the outright and unrestricted ownership of an asset as an individual is uncommon and unnecessary as they are readily available as faction assets, so the acquisition of a personal asset represents independence and the value of an individual to a faction. For example, in a modern context many people own both cars and homes, however few people own and maintain these assets outright and independently.  
Once a character has a personal asset, they can access it at any time without making a acquisition check or spending Social Credit. It is assumed to be relatively self-sustaining, however you can always choose to be maintaining that asset as a downtime activity.

## That Page Where All The Faction Relations Are Listed

#### 

| Relation | Description | Actions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Hostile | Willing to kill you, unwilling to allow you to succeed, seeks ways to take risks to harm you. | Attack with the intent of killing, harm your allies |
| Belligerent | Willing to harm you, unwilling to allow you to pass unnoticed, will harm you with limited risk. | Attack to capture, impose conditions or damage equipment. Shout, argue, and stalk you. |
| Indifferent | Unwilling to help, willing to help those who would harm you. | Bar you from leaving, point you out, remove you from aid. |
| Hospitable | Willing to help without risk. | Accept you into their private space, trade with you, hold something for you, stay quiet for you. |
| Benevolent | Willing to take small risks to help you, unwilling to help your opponents. | aid you in combat (unless they are targeted), give you something worth 1GP or less, heal you |
| Dedicated | Willing to risk their life for you, considers your interests as their own. | Fight for you, give you something worth more than 1GP. |

It is very unusual for creatures to be **Hostile** to one another. It means they intend to kill you and are currently seeking a way to do that. Most of your opponents are not truly hostile. Having any hostile opponents is an unusual and imminent threat that you should resolve quickly.

Normally, when opposed, creatures are considered **Belligerent**. Someone willing to fight you or break your things is as dangerous and violent as most people are willing to get.

An **Indifferent** person or organization is perfectly contented to see you fail. This relation is usually held by people who are untrusting and suspicious by nature, or have some reason to believe you are not benefitting society.

The usual relation people and organizations have with insiders and “normal” people in society is **Hospitable**. A merchant is being hospitable merely by offering trade, so the vast majority of random people can usually be considered hospitable.

The normal relation that one has with friends and family is **Benevolent**. They operate on a principle of offering and expecting basic levels of aid and accommodations. This is also the relation you have with factions you add through levelling points.

**Dedicated** is a special relation that one usually only shares with a few people in their entire life. You are willing to risk your life for this person and consider your wealth to be shared. This is the relation that a character asset has to you.

### 

### Relations

Relations are the actions we take concerning another entity, whether it’s a faction or an individual. While attitudes and mannerisms are important to role-play, the mechanics of the game concern the actions that are taken, which can sometimes be in striking contrast to the words and sentiments that are expressed.  
Relations are unilateral, they describe how one entity acts toward another. Relationships are the sum of the relations between two or more entities. With only 6 categories of relations and the ability to dip into and borrow from neighboring relations, a near-infinite number of relationships might exist concerning any number of entities.  
Your table can establish the relations you have with an individual or group based on the sum of recent interactions as well as social expectations. Similarly to an inventory call, establishing a relations category is not always important for everyday gameplay, and can usually be done at the start of a relationship or whenever it becomes important to the rules and mechanics of the game. Look at the Relations below to get an idea of the sorts of things that might indicate that your relations might be in one category or another.

##### Enacting Relations

Anything clearly defined as part of your relations status with an individual or group, or anything that is not defined but your table agrees on, takes only an action, not a check. For example, asking a hospitable person to allow you to hide in their car does not require a check. Trying to do something that is one step outside your current relations status does require a faction check, for example asking someone who is hospitable to your target to reveal that they are hiding in the car requires a check to try to make them act indifferent to their guest by giving them up.  
You can enact relations in whatever way you think is most beneficial. For example, you might argue that someone is benevolent to you, so revealing the target hiding in their car falls within your expectations regardless of their relationship with that hiding person. In this case you do not check against the beneficial person, instead it is a faction contest between you and the hiding person to see who can convince the person caught in the middle to help them.  
The result of a challenge might end up with someone acting in a way that is out of line with your expectations. For example, you ask a benevolent ally to reveal the location of someone who is hiding, the hiding person wins the challenge, so the benevolent person refuses to reveal them (thus acting indifferently toward you). This gives you the green light to normalize indifference between you, but it’s up to you to decide if that’s really what you want.

##### Single Actions and Out of Line

You may use leverage and make a check to convince someone to take on a single action of a category above your current relations status, or make a save to recover from undertaking an action that is beneath your expected relations. For example, you may find a valuable trinket but discover the owner is indifferent. Use leverage and a check to try to convince them to undertake the hospitable act of allowing you to buy it. By contrast, you may turn a stranger away in a storm, unsure of whether you should have acted hospitably or indifferently, you make a save against a social condition as you are plagued with anxiety about your choice.

##### Unilateral Changes

These are changes where you are attempting to alter the relations status that a target has with another entity, for example convincing someone to be benevolent to you, or convincing someone to be hostile to another faction. This is not the same as convincing someone to take a single action that would be considered part of the target category.  
This is a graduated check. The first time you make the check, the effect lasts for 1 minute. You must make another check to make it last for 10 minutes, then 1 hour, and so on. The check itself is also graduated in time, taking 1 minute the first time, then 10 minutes and so on, unless you have additional leverage or other ways to alter the check so it can be done more quickly as per the usual rules on graduated checks.

##### Multilateral Changes

Multilateral diplomacy checks are checks to normalize relations and expected behavior. You will know the current relations status and the expectation, for example if an individual is acting indifferent toward you but because of faction relations they are meant to be acting benevolent. You can then make a single faction check to adjust your relations to all match the expectation.  
In order to do this, you must have also adopted the behaviors of the expected relations status. For example, if you are engaged in hostile combat with someone and wish to normalize to expected indifference, you must stop attacking them and tell your allies to leave them alone, then you can make a single faction check to move their relations with you to indifferent.  
The multilateral change takes 1 minute and is permanent.

### Leverage

Leverage overcomes the inertia of social interactions. Most people tend to want to keep things as they are, and are mildly averse to making things different, so there needs to be a certain amount of leverage to get things moving socially. You need to use leverage to get someone to take an action that is one step outside their current relations status. For example, to convince someone who is hospitable toward you to give you 5 supply, or to convince someone who is indifferent toward a 3rd party to throw a rock at them.  
You can use a character’s relation to your party or their fate as leverage if you know it and it is suitable. Otherwise you can expend 1 Social Credit to get things moving purely on your good standing in the community. Barring that, 1 supply is enough to grease the wheels. Some characters have additional ways to exercise leverage from their background, skills or abilities. However you have used leverage, if you make the same check again using the same leverage, you must make a graduated check, meaning it takes longer for each time you do it. You can reduce complicated faction checks from hours to minutes simply by diversifying the ways you exercise leverage.

## Factions As Entities Consisting of Characters and Assets

Factions are groups of humanoids that have collectivized and shared many of their economic and social needs, thus creating a cohesive group of people who have vested interests in their mutual security and success. Factions therefore form an integral part of interacting with humanoids, as even if you can physically overpower an individual, they have collectivized their personal security such that you must first (or later) overcome their faction’s collective power. Furthermore, as an individual, you do not need to rely as heavily in your own personal abilities to overcome the environment, magical threats or physical dangers if you are seen as an integral contributing member of a faction.  
Factions can form for a great number of reasons, but as an individual character, your interaction with them is mostly focused around acquiring Social Credit, which is a faction currency that you can exchange for use of their assets.  
Details about specific factions are offered in official content modules. They include information such as the assets that the faction holds, the types of locales it operates in, its expectations, and its relations with other factions.

### Operations

Factions only operate in certain regions, and usually only certain locales within those regions. For example a gang might only operate in a certain country, and only in gang-held enclaves within that country. Outside of these areas, they exist, however their powers are much more limited. You can usually only access assets in regions where the faction operates, and can only rely on their complete control in their specialized locales. For example, in a locale dominated by a faction, a character can get in touch with a representative of the faction freely and can assume that at least a few identifiable characters in the locale will be faction members, and can establish any faction characters they might like in the locale.

### Membership 

Any character can be loosely affiliated with other members of a faction through narrative or role-play, but they are not considered to be an official member unless they have used one levelling point to adopt official membership into that faction. In this way, faction membership is a type of personal asset.  
Membership immediately grants the benefits of the faction’s relations with other members (always benevolent) and other factions as well as the benefit of being able to access the faction’s assets through social credit.

### Expectations

Factions have norms of behavior and expectations. Usually these are fairly relaxed and well-known. Even if there is a complex series of punishments related to infractions, such a system is there to allow for the infractions to be made and then rectified all while the individual remains a member of the faction. Your table establishes most of the expectations that a faction has.  
You don’t need play mechanically through parking tickets, you can just role-play whether your character is the type of person to get parking tickets or to find legal parking. They are still a member of a faction even if they routinely ignore minor infractions. You are expected to act benevolently toward the representatives of your faction and it would be out-of-line to fail to do so, however it would take significantly more concerted effort and harm to actually be expelled from your faction.  
The ways you can get expelled from your faction are usually specifically defined in their expectations. If you are permanently expelled from your faction (this is always the choice of player), you can re-assign your levelling point to a different faction.  
If a character fails to meet the expectations of a faction, usually presenting as a character failing to act benevolently to other faction members or contravening a major rule, they may be **suspended**. Their access to faction assets is cut off until they normalize relations with a leader, usually by offering a benevolent service to that leader.  
If a player does not want their character to be a member of a faction any more, they can pursue **expulsion** from a faction. Undertaking a narrative arc of betrayal, self-discovery, or some other journey, they will disentangle themselves from the faction and reallocate their faction membership to a different faction.

### Relations

Faction relations are the norm between individuals of either faction. You can use them to try to achieve a multilateral change to relations with another individual and to expect how an individual will react to you and your actions. 

### Assets

One of the primary reasons for forming a faction is to attain and share assets equitably among members. When encountering faction minions or other characters, the assets generally available to the faction might be represented by those creatures having access to that asset at any time.  
Accessing faction assets takes an hour, and the asset will specify whether it costs social credit or not to use it. In either case, a character must be able to use Social C  
redit to use an asset, so their Social Credit for the day must be 1 or higher, and they must not be suffering any condition that prevents them from using social credit. Factions can only distribute their assets in areas in which they operate, so it can take additional time and resources to get to the drop off point. Other assets requirements, such as proficiency or a time restriction on use of the asset will be detailed in their description.

### Market Lists

Market lists, being extensive catalogues of equipment and prices, are an important asset that many factions use to lure membership. Whether they have access to unique items or uniquely low prices, faction-specific market lists can only be used by members. Everyone else uses a generic market list for the setting. 

### Minions

Minions are the low-level everyday people that make up the bulk of all people in the world. Information about a faction’s minions is provided along with other info about the faction in case you would like to interact with your faction. Most of the time you will be interacting with a minion.
