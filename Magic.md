# Chapter 3 : The “Magic” arena of play, dealing with all things arcane

Magic is a major component of Round Table, intended to be used for creative and lateral problem solving. The magic system can be somewhat difficult to master, and the possibilities of any given spell are often not apparent at first glance.

## The Section Detailing Magic, its Characteristics and Uses

### Magic Checks

Magic checks are taken when a creature interacts directly with magical energy. Like all other checks, the creature attempting to initiate a change will roll 2d12 and take the lower result. You can use energy to buff magic check, which is the same energy that is used to buff martial checks, as in Round Table ordinary physical energy is responsible for enacting magic rather than a reserve of some other form of personal energy reserve.  
As with the other arenas of play, a creature targeted by magic can actively resist by making a check themselves, and a check that would result in harm if failed is known as a save.

Consider whether or not a given spell effect grants the caster or the target a new **Natural Ability**. Any abilities granted by spells, such as a new movement speed or sense, are considered natural abilities, and don’t require checks or saves to use in their ordinary intended sense, unlike skills. The ability is likely limited, for example a new sense probably only extends to the range or the area of effect, but within that area you can use it without thinking and without rolling, and you can do so with abilities that are far beyond what a human could normally aspire to.

**For Example**, if you grant a martial character the ability to see and touch the ethereal, they can use their ordinary combat abilities against ethereal creatures, because they are now considered naturally able to do everything needed to fight ethereals.  
If a spell effect would clearly **Cause Harm** to a creature, you can use it like an attack. You can also create a passive effect using your passive magic skill that would impose a debuff or save on those affected. Remember, a failed save deals its remainder in damage, so in this way spells can cause harm as well. In order to use an active attack roll you need to target a creature, while areas of effect are required to use passive effects. The specific condition created by the spell might be detailed in its description, otherwise it is up to the table.

### The Characteristics of Spells

All major arcanum are spells, whereas only the minor arcanum that include descriptions of the following characteristics are spells.

#### Casting Time

The amount of time it takes to cast the spell. During this time, unless the spell requires an altar, you must maintain focus on the spell. If your focus is broken, the spell ends.  
You are considered to have expended the energy requirements of a spell when you start casting it.  
The spell is cast the moment the casting time ends, so if the casting time is one minute or longer, the spell may be difficult to use in tactical encounters like combat. You may have to time the actions of your party to correspond with your casting time. You can use an initiative point to take an action to cast a spell. The casting times are as follows:

* Reaction  
* Action  
* Minute  
* 10 Minutes  
* 1 Hour  
* 1 Day

#### Components

Spells use different components to be cast, being focus, material, or altar components. Each component type may be desirable for its own reasons, and some spells may stipulate that they use multiple component types simultaneously, for example an altar to cast the spell and a number of materials per target.

* #### Focus you must use a focus object, a type of magical equipment, to concentrate on the spell and target for the entire casting time and duration as your action. If you lose the ability to sense the target, or to take an action to maintain focus, or someone succeeds at a check against you with the goal of breaking your focus, the spell ends entirely.

* #### Material means you must use spell materials to cast the spell, however you do not need to maintain focus on the spell during its casting time or duration. Only targets within range are affected, but the spell does not end if the targets or the caster leave the range or hide.

* #### Altar means you must use a tier-appropriate altar to cast the spell. This is usually in the possession of a faction. Altars cannot be moved and they can only be sanctified by factions. Only targets within range are affected, but the spell does not end if the targets or the caster leave the range. The caster must remain within the range while casting a spell, but does not need to focus for the casting time or duration.

#### 

#### 

#### Duration

This is how long the spell remains in effect from the moment the casting time is over. The duration can be cut short if the spell ends, for example if it requires focus that is lost, or is interrupted by abjuration. Duration times follow the same pattern as casting times: 

* Reaction  
* Action  
* Minute  
* 10 Minutes  
* 1 Hour  
* 1 Day

#### Relation

Spells can be seen as harmful or beneficial, impolite, strange, horrifying, terrorizing, gallant, and many other adjectives. The relation characteristic of a spell is how it is received by those affected by the spell using the categories of faction relations detailed in the factions chapter. Relations will affect how easy it is to request that someone perform a spell on your behalf, and the social impact of casting spells in public as well as private. If you are seen turning someone’s blood to ash, you may be a saint or a terrorist depending on the circumstances and faction relations, but at least you have a handy tag to let you know it’s hostile. The relation characteristic of the spell is meant to apply to the use of the spell described in the text. It may not suit a particular use case, for example using a spell tagged as “hospitable” to ultimately cause harm to the targets, would not be hospitable after all. A spell can fall into any of the relations statuses:

* Hostile  
* Belligerent  
* Indifferent  
* Hospitable  
* Benevolent  
* Dedicated

#### Targets

This is the number of individuals affected by the spell in the way the spell describes when it mentions “targets”. Targets must be selected by the spell caster, so the caster must be able to target an object or creature. Creatures that are under cover, or otherwise not available to the primary sense of the caster cannot be targeted. This applies to both beneficial and harmful effects. If the spell requires focus, it can be ended on a target by obscuring the target such that they can no longer be targeted, thus taking cover from such a spell is an effective defense.  
A caster can always target themselves, even if they are blinded. A spell effect will usually specify that it targets creatures or objects exclusively. If it doesn’t specify, you can target either. The number of targets can be any whole number.

#### Energy

Casting spells is hard work. It takes a mental and physical toll on the caster represented by an energy cost that is expended at the beginning of the casting time. On average, characters start with 3 energy, so many major arcanum are not accessible to level 1 characters simply because of their energy cost, which is often 5 for Major Arcanum. Energy is not exclusively magical in nature, it is the same biochemical energy that people use to run or think.

#### Range

This is the distance between the edge of the caster’s hand or square in a combat grid, and the centre of the spell’s effect. If the spell also has an area, this means it is centred at the end of the range or closer. If the range is being calculated to a target, this means that the number of squares (or meters) between caster and target must be less than or equal to the range.  
Spells are considered to travel in a straight line without being blocked by physical objects If a target is being targeted through reflections or other means, the range does not take the path of the targeting sense into account.  
If the range is touch, a caster’s attempt to touch an unwilling target is considered part of the spell’s checks or saves, they do not need to make an additional attack check.  
The max range is set when you create the spell, however when you cast it you can choose to cast it at a shorter range. The range can be any whole number in meters, however official content usually follows these categories:

* Touch/0m  
* 2m  
* 10m  
* Locale/100m  
* Strategic/500m

#### Area

This is the side length of a square in which the spell takes place. The spell can be any symmetrical geometric shape within the area such as a triangle, square, donut or pentagon. You choose the shape of the area when you create the spell. remember, the range reaches to the centre of the area, so in order to make a cone that projects 10m from the caster’s finger tips, your range must be at least 5m. You cannot choose to alter the geometry of the area when you cast the spell, but you can generally cast a spell such that the area is placed exactly as you intend, hitting some targets while missing others, if this is possible. Area can be any whole number of meters but is generally expressed in these categories:

* Touch/0m  
* 2m  
* 4m  
* 10m  
* Locale/100m

### School of Magic

Many spells, and some creatures, skills, abilities and other parts of the game may explicitly impact schools of magic, for example buffing or debuffing spells cast from these schools. The schools of magic are socially constructed categories of how the magic functions, where it comes from, and its effects, so they do not correspond perfectly with any of these constraints. A spell that is created by a similar process to an evocation, but which causes materials to transform for the purpose of damaging constructs (for example heating certain alloys), may in fact be categorized as a transmutation, because it alters materials and is particularly effective against constructs, and the actual energies involved are secondary to the effect. For the benefit of simplified gameplay, these effects and functionalities are categorized into schools of magic. Players and characters can use the language of the schools of magic to study and understand them more easily, while at its core there is a single poorly understood magical energy system that underpins the Round Table universe.

**Abjuration** is the school of magic that deals with magical energy directly, the "veil" of magical energy that appears to permeate the entire universe, and meta-knowledge of the functionality of magic. In practical terms, abjuration is most obvious to the average person in the use of anti-magic such as talismans and wards, which are very commonly employed across all levels of society. They usually convert any other spells back into abstract arcane energy, dissipating the effects, and this is the extent of knowledge the average person might have over Abjuration. Whether for better or worse, powerful abjurers must come to a more profound understanding of the nature of magic and the 'veil' of magical energy all around us. Once they achieve this understanding, they can read, interpret, or otherwise come to understand magic, spells, creatures and devices in ways ordinary people cannot comprehend. Soon, their manipulation of pure magical energy allows them to shift, or even pierce the "veil", banishing or summoning extraplanar creatures, or even traveling between planes. Abjuration is often therefore misunderstood as pertaining only to defensive wards, or being the school of "pure wizardry," with terrifying, mind-bending possibilities.

**Divination** deals with the encoding, reading and storing of information within the veil of magic that permeates the universe. Practically speaking, most people dabble or experience divination in the case of minor predictions, advice, or insights into themselves or their immediate surroundings. Parlour tricks such as palm reading, or reading the history of artifacts from their surface are common. Diviners who plumb the depths of this field will find that aside from simply reading or predicting minor and inconsequential local events, they can extend their perception far beyond the local, both physically and metaphysically. After that, they will come around to understand that the field of divination is not all that it seems, as they soon become capable of secreting away information, or even altering the veil to obscure or simply misrepresent the signs that lesser diviners accept as facts.  
**Enchantment** is the perception or alteration of the emotional states of semi-intelligent or intelligent beings. Because all being exist within the context of a magical universe, magic runs through their minds, even if they are not essentially magical creatures. Many societies write volumes to justify or categorize "good" and "evil" enchantments, and enchantments are often considered as hostile as physical violence. In fact, enchanting someone without consent is usually criminal, and physical violence is considered to be a wise form of defense from enchanters. Simple tricks and cons are the most common form of enchantments, but those who study the field in depth will come to radical understandings of the self, society, the mind, and their own humanity that will set them apart. For good or evil, they will be capable of quickly and effectively destroying or re-building a person without any need for the dirty game of combat.

**Evocation** is the conversion between the arcane and the physical. Often pursued for its incredible potential, the physical limitations of the universe at once appear stalwart, yet fragile. Most commonly, evocation converts a small amount of arcane energy into a physical form such as sound, to create a bang, or a tiny amount of heat. Many people are underwhelmed by these tricks of lighting a candle, but some see that an enormous climate-altering forest fire starts from nothing but a precisely placed candle flame. Those who come to master evocation can learn to directly cause somewhat strong physical energies to manifest, even telekeneisis, small fire spouts, deafening bangs, and other, stranger effects. They may also come to understand the world of the elementals, machines, and constructs, allowing them to use energy to strongly manipulate such things. Perfecting evocation usually involves both an understanding of the magic, and an understanding of the physical world to set off chain reactions that are millions of times more powerful than an individual's action.

Every living thing contains **Life Magic**. In fact, there is a strong argument in the world of Round Table that an essential component of the definition of life is its association with magical energies. Beyond simple chemical reactions, there is magic happening in all life forms. Usually, healing magic is a source of both relief and anxiety in larger society, for all the same reasons that the medical professions are highly esteemed, but also extremely regulated. Beyond the common and highly regarded life-saving abilities of healers, there is a course of dangerous and hideous research, and sitting tantalizingly close to life is death and undeath; the persistence of a creature through life magic without the need for a physical form. It can and has been said by some that any form of life magic is evil necromancy, even if the ends are good, the means are unjustifiable.

The change of one substance into another from simple evaporation to the metamorphosis of a butterfly is incredible. The use of arcane energy to promote such transformation is **Transmutation**. The most common transmutations are mindless to common folk. Rituals to ensure bread has a flaky crust are cast off as mundane. Specialist skills to create porcelaine, or mythical metals are usually what common people actually associate with transmutation, and of course the legends and insane reaches of transmutation to create constructs or transform lead into gold could be possible, or not. A simple baker may never know.

## The Definitions of Magical Equipment That You Might Come Across in the Worlds 

Magic tools are very useful, sometimes completely necessary, for the use of spells, especially Major Arcanum. Some Major Arcanum spells use so much energy, or are so limited that they must be used in conjunction with magic tools to be made very effective, while others can be transformed through the proper use of powerful tools from trivial parlor tricks to legendary powers.  
The following general guides will help you understand how the respective magic tools are used, however the tools themselves, their specific functions and values are found in equipment lists in official content.  
Unless otherwise specified, magic tools cannot be destroyed by mortal means.

### Wands, Rods and Staves

These are long, slender implements made of magically conductive materials that allow a caster to focus their energies more precisely, conferring bonuses for spells with targets, especially a single target. For example, they might allow someone to increase the range of a single target spell.

### Scrolls and Tablets

Whether they are stone tablets, parchment, floppy discs, or any other material, a scroll is a portable instance of a spell containing instructions for its use. Any character who knows a Major Arcanum can cast it into the scroll, which can then be used by anyone proficient with scrolls. Each scroll has a casting time to access their stored spells. While it is in the scroll, it is inaccessible to the original caster, however if they die their spell may persist, thus scrolls can be found empty or already loaded. Unlike almost any other magic item, scrolls can be destroyed by ordinary means.

### Books and Cards

Spell books allow those proficient in their use to copy extensive notes and magical formulas into their pages, transforming them into an indestructible magical items and allowing their owners to cast the Major Arcanum contained within as if they were using an altar. Spell codices are written in a code unique to their owners, and are not usable to anyone else without learning the code. Decks of magical cards contain shorthand notes and enchantments that work just like spell books.

### Rings, Crowns and Chains

Rings, Crowns and Chains are specialized items that allow their wearer to focus their energies inward, augmenting spells that target the caster. Examples of the effects of these items might be that they reduce casting time or energy for spells targeting the caster, or increase the area of effect on spells cast with a range of touch.

### Chronometers

All chronometers are complex machines that allow the caster to stretch the time between casting and spell effect. Pocket watches allow the caster to release the effect with the click of its button. Digital watches additionally allow the caster to release the effect in the location that the spell was cast, even if the caster is no longer there (they must be within range). Egg-watches are small construct computers that can be instructed to release the effect under certain triggers, even if the caster is out of range and cannot sense the triggers.

### Prisms

Crystals, dice, orbs and all other geometric devices are used to focus, refract and amplify arcane energy. Spells’ areas of effect or number of targets can be augmented, for example a triangular prism may allow the caster to automatically include two other people in any spell targeting the caster, or an orb might increase the range of any spell with an area of effect.

## What Are the Minor Arcanum and the List of Generic Ones

Minor Arcanum are abilities that an individual can train that allow them to manipulate magic in new and interesting ways. Minor arcanum function identically to all other abilities, you earn them using levelling points, and once learned you can apply them wherever they make sense.

## The Section Dealing with the Major Arcanum and Their Examples

Major arcanum are powerful spells that require a very restrictive amount of energy. Major arcanum are learned in the same way that minor arcanum are, however their availability is much more limited. You only have the opportunity to spend levelling points to acquire individual major arcanum as your character discovers them and adventures to acquire them. There is no master list of major arcanum, they are released through official content in a similar manner to equipment lists.

Relation: Hospitable  
Targets: One  
Energy: 5  
Range: 100m  
Area: None  
You are able to see from a target object as if it were your eye or use the primary sense of a target creature. You still have the same faculties of sight as you naturally do, but your target object can be considered an additional source of your natural vision or your target creature can be considered to provide you with its natural primary sense in addition to your own. Your target can come under the dazzled/blinded condition, and if it does, all your ordinary senses are dazzled/blinded too and the spell ends.

###### **Agnosia \[Enchantment\]**

Duration: One Minute  
Relation: Belligerent  
Targets: One  
Energy: 5  
Range: Touch  
Area: None  
You cause the target to be completely unable to identify you for the duration.

Relation: Hostile  
Targets: One  
Energy: 3  
Range: Touch  
Area: None  
Make a spell attack to convince a target minion of your level or lower to be loyal to you. On a success, the minion is devoted to you permanently. This spell is considered hostile, so on a failure the minion will become hostile, but even on a success the minion’s other associates may become hostile.

###### **Belligerent Presence \[Enchantment\]**

Casting Time: One Minute  
Components: Focus  
Duration: One Minute  
Relation: Belligerent  
Targets: None  
Energy: 5  
Range: Touch  
Area: 6m  
You flood the area with an overwhelming sense of your angry presence. Every creature in the area must save against your passive magic skill, becoming belligerent to you on a failure, and succumbing to the *afraid* condition if they critically fail. Additionally, every affected creature in the area feels that you are physically or magically perceiving them directly, searching them, possibly scrying their thoughts. This may cause hidden creatures to give up hiding or creatures hiding things to act erratically. You and your allies are buffed when using this spell to investigate, interrogate or gather information.

###### **Sense Energy \[Evocation\]**

CASTING TIME: Ten Minutes  
COMPONENTS: Material  
DURATION: One Hour  
Relation: Benevolent  
TARGETS: One  
Energy: 5  
RANGE: touch  
AREA: 100m  
Targets can sense the existence and intensity of a selected physical energy in the area within range such as heat, light, sound etc. They can sense if energy sources are flowing or moving through the area and can designate targets as if this sense was their primary natural sense, for example targeting “the hottest object in the room.” They can sense extremely low energy levels, sensing clearly in near perfect darkness, silence or cold. If targets of this spell are *blinded* after casting the spell, this spell ends instead.

###### **Temperate \[Evocation\]**

Casting Time: One Minute  
Components: Focus  
Duration: One Minute  
Relation: Belligerent  
Targets: None  
Energy: 3  
Range: Touch  
Area: 6m  
Moderate and diffuse light, heat or sound in the area. Elementals consider the area rough terrain regardless of the energy you choose to temperate. Creatures saving or actively defending against the energy type you selected who are within the area and duration can use your proficiency bonus instead of theirs. Targets cannot be selected into, within, or out of the area using the energy type you selected for the duration.  
Spikes in the energy type, such as a hot object or bright flash are diffused over time and space to be effectively eliminated. Energy from ordinary sources such as a flashlight or shout do not cross the area, but may be perceived as being within the area even though they cannot be precisely located.

###### **Mystic Bolt \[Evocation\]**

Casting Time: One Minute  
Components: Material  
Duration: One Minute  
Relation: Hostile  
Targets: 3  
Energy: 6  
Range: Touch  
Area: 6m  
After the casting time, you must touch each target within the duration and area with a spell component, which is then consumed. At the end of the duration, a bolt of energy is instantaneously discharged between the targets that are still within the area, constituting a magic attack against them causing the immobilized/paralyzed condition. The act of touching the targets is not inherently hostile until the spell takes effect, however it is clearly part of a spell casting.

###### **Blast Consciousness \[Life Magic\]**

Casting Time: Action  
Components: Focus  
Duration: Instantaneous  
Relation: Belligerent  
Targets: One  
Energy: 3  
Range: Touch

Casting Time: One Minute  
Components: Material  
Duration: One Hour  
Relation: Hospitable  
Targets: One  
Energy: 3  
Range: Touch  
Area: None  
The target is surrounded by a faint light, buffing checks and saves to heal physical and magical conditions or against possession by undead for the duration. Additionally, when you cast this spell you can make a check to expel any undead possessing the target. The faint light causes undead to save against the afraid/panicked condition whenever they first perceive it.

###### **Sympathetic Touch \[Life Magic\]**

Casting Time: One Hour  
Components: Material  
Duration: Instantaneous  
Relation: Devoted  
Targets: 4  
Energy: 5  
Range: Touch  
Area: None  
When you begin casting this spell, you will take on a number of conditions corresponding to the number of spell components used, to the maximum of the spell’s target number that the creature you are touching is suffering from. You retain these conditions for the casting time, and indefinitely if the spell is not completed successfully. Otherwise, both you and the origin of these target conditions are relieved of them at the end of the casting time. If you take on a condition such as paralyzed, which would prevent you from completing the spell, you retain the condition but do not complete the spell.

###### **Slip/Stick \[Transmutation\]**

Casting Time: One Minute  
Components: Material  
Duration: One Minute  
Relation: Indifferent  
Targets: None  
Energy: 3  
Range: Touch  
Area: 10m  
Cause every solid surface of objects not carried or worn by creatures in the area to become either slick or sticky. This makes maneuvers across the area risky by default, and may impose your magic skill save on various actions such as opening doors. You can make a check to have this spell affect the surfaces of a target construct within the area or deal damage to it.

###### **Quicken/Thicken \[Transmutation\]**

Casting Time: One Minute  
Components: Focus  
Duration: One Minute  
Relation: Indifferent  
Targets: None  
Range: Touch  
Area: 6m   
You make a specified liquid in the area not in direct contact with non-construct creatures more or less viscous for the duration. This will make maneuvers across the area risky for creatures that are naturally suited to swimming through the ordinary viscosity of the liquid. You can use this spell to directly damage machines and constructs that rely on the liquid being a specific viscosity (cars and oil, for example), or creatures that rely on the ambient liquid for survival (fish and water, for example) if they remain inside the area for the entire duration.

###### **Congeal/Unseal \[Transmutation\]**

Casting Time: One Hour  
Components: Material  
Duration: Instantaneous  
Relation: Belligerent  
Targets: Two  
Range: Touch  
Area: None  
Adhere two objects together, or make a check to repair an object. Alternatively, you can dissolve any glue without a check, or make a check to break welds, magic seals or any other bond between two objects. This spell cannot be used to unseal things stuck together by the very same spell. When the spell ends, the objects are not considered to be magically bonded (it cannot be dispelled), but nor is there any physical glue present. You can use this spell as an attack against constructs and objects that require tight seals like pressure vessels or mobility like wheels. You cannot unscrew, unlatch, or otherwise move mechanisms with this spell.
