# Chapter 2 : The “Martial” Arena Of Play, Dealing With Actions, Maneuvers, And Tactics

The Martial arena deals with the characters bodies in round table. Whether you are using it to move or act, if you are doing something primarily with you muscles, you are in the martial arena. It is fast-acting, working in seconds or fractions of seconds, but it is relatively limited in scope by the range of your arm’s reach, your standing leap, direct line-of-sight, and other physical limitations.

## The Section On Tactics, Covering Time Space And Actions Performed Therein

### Tactical Challenges

Tactical challenges include discrete groups of actions and reactions that take a minute or less to complete that represent turning points or pivotal moments with the possibility of both success and failure, and significant impacts in both cases. Tactical challenges can often be used to represent key moments in longer events, or be set up by martial creatures and characters to create an inflection point to turn the tide of a larger event. For example, a sports game can be envisioned and played as either an hour-long strategic event, or a short set of 2-3 key tactical moments that define the result of the game, or even a combination of both. The same may be applied for such activities as scaling a cliff or engaging in a battle, or even finding a suitor at a ball or an entire dungeon crawl.  
These tactical challenges are played out in seconds culminating to a minute, usually broken down into 1-10 discrete rounds of a few seconds. A round is divided into opposing sides or teams. There can be anywhere from 1 to 4 or more sides depending on the nature of the challenge. Each side takes their turns together in whatever order the individuals on the side want. The order in which the sides take their turns is established by the initiative phase, as is the composition of the sides. Individuals on a side can move and act, declaring both their movement and their action, then resolving both before the next character’s turn. Once everyone on one side has taken a turn, the next side takes their turns.

### Range and Geometry

There are 4 tactical zones of range that originate at a creature; touch, short, medium, and long range.  
Touch is the area adjacent to the creature’s appendages. Some creatures have long appendages that can extend this range. Human touch extends to 1m on either side of the human, meaning the human’s touch range occupies a 2x2m area.  
Short range is the range that a creature can effectively control without relocating, through the use of “moving around”, lunging or leaping, polearms, and other implements. It is a small room, or a football (soccer) goal. Short range for humans is about 6x6m.  
Medium range is the range that a creature must orient their bodies (maneuver) to address, and the range that they can typically throw things. For humans, it is 10m, which is how far a human can hustle along in their turn, or how far they could be expected to accurately and effectively throw a rock or hammer.  
Long range is too far for a creature to consider covering in their turn. It is usually the entire tactical map past 20m. It is effectively irrelevant to a creature’s goals on their turn except that most ranged weapons are used at long range, and most creatures can use their primary senses at long range.  
Strategic range is explicitly non-tactical in nature. It covers 300m or more, allowing those with strategic rage capabilities to affect a tactical environment while effectively remaining outside it.

### Maneuvers

A maneuver is a discrete action that your body takes during a round, usually with the effect of moving from one place to another. A maneuver must be described as a single action such as “swim to shore”, and the effect of the maneuver is that your body is somewhere else at the end of your turn. Normally, you cannot use your maneuver to affect other creatures, however martial characters can use martial plays to make use of their maneuvers in novel ways.

Almost all creatures have a method of **Natural Movement** that represents their ordinary locomotion. Some creatures have several such modes of natural movement. Moving naturally over favorable terrain in clear conditions does not require a check or a save. For example a human can walk 10m over clear level terrain without a check, even while they are taking other actions.  
Other maneuvers might be considered natural movement, such as dropping from a ledge, standing up, opening and walking through a door, etc.

If it is possible for a creature to undertake a maneuver, they may be **Proficient or Non-proficient**. A human, for example, cannot possibly fly. It is not a question of proficiency. A human can possibly jump 4m, but there is a question of whether or not any given human is proficient at jumping because not all humans can naturally jump 4m. Proficient means you are specifically trained and knowledgeable about the maneuver at hand, and you add your skill bonus to your roll. Non-proficient means you can make the attempt, and there is some (even remote) possibility of success and failure. You roll without adding your skill bonus.  
When you determine proficiency, it is based on the entire maneuver you are undertaking. If you are not proficient at any single component of the maneuver, you are not considered proficient at the entire maneuver. It can be helpful to split up your maneuver over several turns, or to undertake non-proficient components as actions or abilities to avoid failing at the entire maneuver.

You can use your maneuver to **Move Recklessly**. This is to say undertake a maneuver that will cause harm if you fail. A maneuver is judged to be risky if any component of the maneuver is risky. If this is the case, the maneuver check instead becomes a save, meaning the result of the failure is interpreted as a corresponding amount of damage.

From the perspective of humans, the following types of terrain are commonly encountered that may represent a check, being unsure or a save, being downright dangerous.  
Checks:

* #### Squeezing through a slot smaller than a doorway, or squeezing around a cramped space such as a vehicle

* #### Scrambling up or down a steep slope or vertical drop smaller than the height of your outstretched arms.

* #### Scrambling across shifting terrain such as sand, snow, or gravel, on a watercraft, or on all fours across ice, mud or other slippery surfaces.

Saves:

* #### Dropping from or free climbing up or down a height more than double your own.

* #### Scrambling over furniture, debris, or other objects.

* #### Running, skidding or sliding across ice, uneven or unseen terrain, or steep slopes.

* #### Running through brush, slots smaller than doorways, or breakaway objects like paper walls.

* #### Running while taking an action counter to your maneuver such as wrestling, carrying more than your body weight, or putting on clothes.

You can also use your maneuver each round to do other things. Think of maneuvers as what you are doing with your body, and not your hands. If you would like to jump off a moving cart, or slide down a hill, or bodycheck your way through a door, these are maneuvers. All of these maneuvers would also require a check or save. You can also hide, fall prone, and do any of the maneuvers that your character has as martial plays.

##### Moving Around

You can use your maneuver to increase your reach to short range, allowing you to interact with any number of individuals or objects within a short distance (6m) from you more-or-less simultaneously. For example you might open a door, peek out a window, take something from an ally, and roll up a rug all within a the confines of a room. While the discrete movements of your body are complex, they all fall within the definition of “moving around”. You can also use moving around to react to creatures or objects entering or leaving that entire area with your reaction. In this way, as a reaction to whatever event you specified, you can move within your moving around area to the spot you specified. For example “if he comes closer I will back away” or “if he tries for either door I will block the one he’s trying.”

##### Taking Cover

You can use your maneuver to take cover, drop prone in tall grass, move out of cover to shoot and then back again, or move between cover that is within your movement range, and anything else that would result in you obscuring yourself from your enemies. While you are under cover you cannot be targeted by attacks or spells. Cover is not universal. Cover from one direction does not necessarily confer cover from another angle. Your GM may also require a check to be made to attain cover if you are trying to cover behind something smaller than you, or something that could be shot through like bushes or paper walls. A creature using their maneuver to take cover, move between cover, or shoot from cover is not under cover during their turn, only between their turns.

### Actions

Actions are what you are doing, mostly with your hands, to affect other creatures or objects on your turn, contrasted to maneuvers which largely only affect yourself and use your legs or whole body. Martial actions are things you are doing that require strength or dexterity to accomplish like tying a rope, passing a ball, lifting something, etc.  
You can use a weapon or other implement to physically **Attack** a creature or object. The resolution and consequences of attacks are covered in Chapter 6\.  
If you take a maneuver on your turn, you can use your action to **repeat the maneuver**. Thus you can move twice as far, try to jump a fence twice, drop off two separate ledges, etc. You usually can’t take two different maneuvers unless you have an ability that allows you to do so.  
There are a wide range of non-martial actions that can be taken in tactical time, such as spells with a casting time of one action, checks to know, observe or establish details of the locale or creatures there, and others. These other actions are detailed in the respective chapters covering their arena of play.

### Minor Actions

A minor action is something that you can do either simultaneously with a more complex action, or very quickly. Minor actions include things like dropping something, drawing a weapon, opening a door or peeking around a corner. You can usually only take one minor action on your turn.  
One of the most common minor actions is to **Communicate**. It might be useful to think of Maneuvers as what you are doing with your body, Actions as what you are doing with your hands, and Minor Actions as what you are doing with your mouth, but of course there are exceptions.

### Reactions

Unlike the rest of your actions and maneuvers, you take a reaction on someone else’s turn. The reaction generally takes a similar amount of time as a minor action, so you cannot take a full action such as an attack or casting a spell with a casting time of an action as your reaction. Instead, you will almost always be using your reaction to make a check or save against something that is happening to you on someone else’s turn.

Most commonly, you will be using your reaction in combat to make an **active defense** against an incoming attack. Rather than rely on your passive defense, you can use your reaction to make a check to totally annul an incoming attack by exceding the opponent’s roll. You can make this decision after you learn the opposing roll has defeated your passive defense.

You can also use your reaction to **Cooperate** with a team member by doing something on their turn such as handing them something.

You can only use one reaction per round, even if you are faced with multiple attacks or other checks, so choose wisely\!

## The Characteristics of Tactical Equipment, Including Weapons

### Weapon Characteristics

Weapons cause damage, detailed in the next section. They also have other features such length of melee weapons, effective range of ranged weapons and the following tags:

* **Reload** means you must take an action to reload before each shot, and expend one supply before you use the weapon each day.  
* **Clip Reload** Allows you to reload only when you use rapid fire, not when you make regular attacks with the weapon in question. You expend one supply before you use the weapon each day.  
* **Rapid Fire** Allows you to use your weapon to passively attack everything in a 2m area that you designate, as well as creatures passing through or leaving cover in the area for the next round.  
* **Overkill** allows you to apply damage done to an object or vehicle to all the creatures covered by that object or inside the vehicle.  
* **Chunky Salsa** If the area of effect of this weapon is enclosed on all but one side, or on all sides by a material that cannot be destroyed by the explosion, the damage from the explosion is contained within the available area, however it is doubled.

**Melee weapons** are either short, medium or long, referring to the physical length of the weapon itself.

* Short weapons like knives can be concealed, and used in a clinch or when squeezing, but not when riding a mount.  
* Medium weapons cannot be concealed and cannot be used in a clinch or when squeezing but can be used mounted.   
* Long weapons are longer that the wielder is tall, cannot be concealed, or used in a clinch or squeezing, and are debuffed when used inside.

You cannot use **Ranged Weapons** while squeezing or in a clinch unless otherwise stated. They have the following effective ranges:

* Thrown weapons have a maximum effective range of 10m, unless otherwise specified. Once thrown, thrown weapons can be collected from the map after the combat as long as your side did not flee or hide to end combat.  
* Short Range weapons are debuffed on attacks further than 10m within the locale.  
* Long Range weapons have a range that crosses an entire locale.  
* Strategic Range weapons are long range, but can also be used to make attacks into a locale from outside it.

### Armour and Damage

After you calculate whether or not a weapon attack hits, you add weapon damage to the result, subtract damage reduction of armour, and are left with a result that is interpreted into a minor or critical condition. Attacks are detailed in the chapter on Consequences, and Conditions are detailed in the chapter on Advanced Rules.  
The important factor here is that weapons have a damage rating, and armour has a damage reduction rating.  
Statistically speaking, a weapon that adds 3 or more damage turns most hits lethal. These are lethal weapons. Some weapons are designed specifically to do less harm such as sports implements, and therefore have a negative damage modifier, being non-lethal weapons. Weapons dealing 5 or more extra damage are so powerful they cannot be expected to hit without grievous injury or death, and can sometimes cause harm by narrowly missing, meaning even armour becomes ineffective. This means armour ratings are typically 3 or below, eliminating the danger of some lethal weapons but not all.  
We are therefore presented with a spectrum  
From \-2 up to \+6 damage for weapons, with \+1 and \+2 weapons being common harmful tools and small weapons, and \+3 and \+4 being extremely dangerous lethal weapons, and \+5 and \+6 being devastating military weaponry.  
Conversely, sports equipment, heavy clothing, and other common protective items are \-1 damage reduction, light military armour being \-2, heavy duty protection being \-3.  
Equipment lists will specify both damage ratings and damage reduction for weapons and armour, these guides are just to provide some idea of the range involved. Naturally some items like miniguns and full plate armour might exceed the values given here.

## The Entire List of Martial Plays to Bootstrap the Game

### Maneuvers

All plays take 1 energy to perform.  
Maneuvers are integral to a martial character turning the tide in a challenge. Recon and faction-based characters can often set up ambushes, traps, and terrain obstacles that would leave the party helplessly exposed. Through incredible feats of physicality and acrobatics, martial characters can eschew these disadvantages and turn any battlefield into a killing floor. Martial characters also use maneuvers when mounted to make the most of their mount’s abilities.

#### **Mobile Attack**

Make an attack as a component of your maneuver, making two attacks if you use your action to double your maneuver.

#### **Bullrush**

Pass through opponents as a component of your maneuver, forcing them to save against your passive martial skill or fall prone.

#### **Bully**

Use your maneuver to close in, push, and generally harass an opponent as a belligerent action. They are considered to be in a clinch with you and you can make an attack with this maneuver to either cause the *afraid* or *angry* condition.

#### **Control the Line of Attack**

As your maneuver, make an attack against an adjacent opponent to move them as if you were in a clinch without touching them.

#### **Mounting Expert**

You can get onto a mount or a vehicle or platform as natural movement even if they are moving. You can also expend 1e in an initiative phase to change your position relative to a mount, vehicle or platform (ie mounting, dismounting, getting in or out, etc).

#### **Parkour**

Make any number of saves against reckless movement with a single reaction. You may be able to use your parkour ability to defend against checks meant to encounter you.

#### **Roughrider**

From a grappling position of control, you can expend 1e as a maneuver to mount an unwilling mount which you can thereafter ride as long as you stay in grappling control.

### Actions

Martial characters are able to take advantage of their turn in ways other characters cannot, especially through increasing the number and variety of actions they can take.  
Remember that all martial plays use one energy.

#### **Choke, Lock, Break**

Circumvent your opponent’s physical damage reduction when you attack from the clinch or control, or make your check to move from the clinch to control also deal damage that ignores damage reduction.

#### **Disarm**

Make an attack that is considered inhospitable. On any hit you disarm your opponent. If you deal damage you take their weapon instead. You can use this attack in the initiative phase by using 1e and an initiative point if an opponent is adjacent to you.

#### **Double Strike**

Make two attacks as your attack action.

#### **Spellsword**

Make an attack with your weapon that is considered to be magical in nature, causing the *malcomposed* condition.

#### **Hold for the Shot**

Hold an attack or photograph action, allowing you to make full use of it as a reaction to a stated event. You can also use 1e and 1 initiative point to make an ordinary attack as the very last part of an initiative phase.

#### **Sniper**

Target objects or creatures up to double your ranged weapon’s range.

#### **Trip**

Make an attack against an opponent that is considered indifferent rather than belligerent on any hit. If you deal damage, you additionally knock them prone. 

#### **Footwork**

Maneuver half your tactical speed as a component of an attack. If you are in a clinch you can freely move half your tactical speed as a component of trying to gain control even if you fail to gain control.

#### **Assassinate**

If you hit with an attack, opponents must use their reaction to attempt a check to identify you as the attacker. If you miss, you are identified automatically.

#### **Duel**

If an opponent attacked you last round, you can use this ability to buff attacks against them this round.

### Minor Actions

Minor actions can have an amplified importance to martial characters, who can use them to compliment their already deadly actions on their turn.  
Minor action martial plays also require 1 energy.

#### **Lunge**

“Move around” as a minor action.

#### **Feint**

Debuff all defenses against your attacks this round.

#### **Arrest the Blade**

Clinch an adjacent opponent.

#### **Quick Wrestler**

Take any grappling action.

#### **Spring Up**

Get up from prone or climb up to your height.

#### **Reload**

Reload a Weapon

#### **Savage Attack**

Make an attack after causing a minor condition.

### Reactions

Martial characters can use reactions to powerful effect, denying the actions of their opponents, or even taking their own actions outside of their turn.  
Martial Plays that are reactions still require 1 energy.

#### **Art of Defense**

Actively defend any number of attacks against you.

#### **Parry-Riposte**

Make an attack after a successful active defense.

#### **Time of the Hand and Foot**

Make an attack as a reaction to someone maneuvering into our out of adjacency to you.

#### **Redirection**

Gain grappling control as a reaction to successfully defending against grappling control.

#### **Void**

Move back 2m behind you as a reaction to an attack, causing the attack to miss.

#### **Indomitable Attack**

Make an attack as a reaction to being critically injured
