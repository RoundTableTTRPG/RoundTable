# Round Table
Round table is a folk-fantasy RPG about parties of ordinary people who must forge their fate in a world much grander than themselves. It takes place among isolated regions of diverse and vibrant cultures trying to eke out an existence in an unforgiving universe that does not yield to human endeavor.
# Fundamentals
**Round Table** is a table-top RPG on a table with no sides or corners. Your character and the world are meant to emerge from cooperative play. It facilitates and encourages changing player roles throughout a campaign, the regular intro and outro of Player-characters, and the cooperative bottom-up development of individual characters and the wider world.
**Folk Fantasy** is about the ordinary people that make up the world. World building is focused on small communities and cultures. Character generation is about a characterâ€™s place in a larger society. Play relies on cooperation with the non-player world to overcome dangers that no hero can face.
The core resolution mechanic is a **2d12 system** that takes advantage of your strategic thinking and teamwork to overcome the harshness and dangers of the world.
You roll 2d12 and take the lower, unless you are buffed. If you are proficient in the action, you can expend energy or social credit to buff yourself. You can find other ways to buff yourself as you play.
There are **4 Arenas of Play** that help you translate the narrative to the mechanics and back, allowing you to take actions and set expecations within these arenas of Martial, Magic, Factions and Recon.
Once you have decided on an action, the resolution considers a flexible system of possible **consequences**, including dealing damage, learning information, setting up initiatve, or changing social dynamics, positon or location that accounts for pass-fail states or levels of success, including coveted breakthrougs.
