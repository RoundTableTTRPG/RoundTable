# Chapter 1 : Core Concepts and Introductory Information {#chapter-1-:-core-concepts-and-introductory-information}

Round Table is a folk-fantasy RPG about parties of ordinary people who must forge their fate in a world much grander than themselves. It takes place among isolated regions of diverse and vibrant cultures trying to eke out an existence in an unforgiving universe that does not yield to human endeavor.

**Folk Fantasy** is about the ordinary people that make up the world. World building is focused on small communities and cultures. Character generation is about a character’s place in a larger society. Play relies on cooperation with the non-player world to overcome dangers that no hero can face.

**Folk Magic** is accessible, practical, and part of everyday life. It is so ordinary, in fact, that its very existence should sometimes come into question. Spells to conceal things hidden from sight, to know things commonly known, to speak languages people often speak, to heal ailments that are commonly healed; these are the practical applications of folk magic in Round table. They equally beg the question of why one would practice magic when they could learn the corresponding skill instead, but also why learn the skill when magic will do the trick. Magic seeks only to smudge the line between the mundane and arcane.

Your character is **Not Exceptional**. They have a specialty represented by their primary skills, but play is about local people doing local things, and your character and your party are local people doing local things. You do have skills and a willingness to adventure that positions you as the type of person that other folk might ask to do… unusual things.

**The Gods are Small Rocks**, much to the terror of the average person.There is no over-arching group of all-powerful beings dictating things from a mountaintop in Round Table. The people are left in a world of fairies and dragons and jinn to fend for themselves. The divines, a group of beings characterized for their immortality and extra-planar origins, are just one of many equally threatening and powerful creature types, and there is no reason to consider them supreme over any of the others. In fact, they are a preferred snack of the dragons.

**Each level is a mortal struggle** and the odds are not in your favor, but the stories are about the lives of ordinary people, and that’s a reality we all face together. The beginning and end of a character’s story should not be defined by levels 1 and 15\. Your table will define and decide on the story at hand, but dying or retiring will typically be your character’s outro.

**There is no central system of price fixing** or guaranteed availability of any particular items in any particular place. The abilities to buy land, start a business, travel overland, buy or sell goods, associate with certain people, or even possess certain items are neither commonplace nor consistent. From swords to spells to accommodations, sometimes you can buy them at market, sometimes you can’t even own them. Wealth represents your position in society, not the other way around. The top 1% will always have credit available to them, a peasant’s gold is worthless in the face of taxes, regulations and plain old thieves.

### 4 Arenas of Play

There are four Arenas of Play in Round Table that represent four modalities through which one can understand the world and game, and the actions that may be taken as well. Each character and most creatures are proficient in two arenas, meaning they are left vulnerable to the others without support from friends and allies.

#### ![][image1]Martial

Leaping, sliding and smashing their way their way through split-second challenges that are pivotal turning points, creatures that dominate the martial arena use specialized plays, weapons and other equipment to overcome adversity through acrobatics, dexterity or brute force.

#### ![][image2]Factions

Conniving, Investigating, convincing and community building, factions characters play the slower game of intrigue and wit to acquire allies and assets for themselves, their factions and their party.

#### ![][image3]Magic

Ethereal movement, arcane sense and of course casting spells allow magical characters and creatures to solve problems laterally, by altering their very nature. They use their specialized abilities and magical equipment to alter major arcanum from the unremarkable into powerful yet subtle spells.

#### ![][image4]Recon

Spying, hunting, pathfinding, and logistics are largely up to recon focused creatures and characters, who make use of strategies and equipment like packs to overcome challenges set by the environment itself.

### 

### Basic Core Resolution

The core resolution mechanic is a 2d12 system that takes advantage of your strategic thinking and teamwork to overcome the harshness and dangers of the world.  
When faced with an uncertain task, you roll 2d12 and take the lower, unless you are buffed. If you are proficient in the action, you can expend energy or social credit to buff yourself, and you can also add your proficiency bonus. You can find other ways to buff yourself as you play.  
You can use actions described in each arena of play chapter to try to achieve results, described in chapter 6\.

### The General Rules

**Natural Abilities** are things your character can just do without any trouble, such as walking or seeing a flag 100m away. These are your natural abilities. If you want to do something that you are naturally able to do, you say that your character does it and it’s done. You use natural movement to travel long and short distances, and your primary sense to designate targets for other actions and abilities.  
Characters have **Two Primary Skills** that they use to do most activities.  
Skill descriptions will include details about **Proficiencies**, which are specific actions you can take to make checks while adding your skill bonus to the roll. If you try to do something that is outside the scope of any of your proficiencies, you may still attempt the action, but you don’t add your skill bonus to the roll.  
Anything you think you might be able to do, but you or your table are unsure would be successful, will require a **Skill Check**. Here are some examples:

* Maneuvers such as climbing a wall, jumping off a moving horse, or sliding down a hillside.   
* Martial actions such as attacking someone, shooting a bow or gun, or armwrestling.  
* Magic actions such as casting spells to affect objects or people or manipulating the ongoing effects of spells or magical creatures.  
* Faction actions such as investigating, dancing, disguising yourself, or convincing someone of something.  
* Recon actions such as pick pocketing, tracking, or setting up an attack.  
* Saves against anything that affects you, such as slipping on ice, blocking a punch, avoiding public humiliation, or recovering from poison.

If you are proficient in the action, you can expend one energy to **Buff** yourself, taking the higher number, and again adding your proficiency bonus if necessary.  
As you play the game you will uncover other ways to buff yourself and your allies. There is no way to modify your roll aside from buffing it, there are no static modifiers that will add or subtract to your roll, and your proficiency bonus is always equal to your level.  
Some things take a second, or even less **Time** such as throwing a ball (sphere), other things take hours or even days, such as throwing a ball (party). The time it takes to complete an action is defined as either tactical (seconds) or strategic (hours) to help convey some of the mechanical particularities with these time scales.

### Rolls and Results

Skills are defined uniquely, and so there may be gaps and overlaps in your character’s skills. For example, you might be proficient in driving civilian vehicles and also long distance urban travel. In both cases, you can apply your proficiency bonus (only once) to a check you make to drive a car along highways between cities, but you lose your proficiency bonus when trying to find an off-road route that would avoid police surveillance, since that is neither urban travel, nor how civilian vehicles are driven.

**To make a skill check**, roll 2d12, take the lower number, and then add a relevant skill bonus, if you have one.  
For example, you might add your martial skill to a maneuver that is clearly martial in nature, such as interposing yourself in the middle of a fistfight, or you might add your recon skill if it is something like running through tall grass or climbing a tree. 

**\[EXAMPLE\]**

##### Results

Whatever your roll is, you subtract the difficulty of the enterprise, either the base difficulty of the locale, or a passive or defensive skill in an opponent. Never an arbitrary number selected by the GM.

#### **For example**, if you swing a sword at someone and get 7-8, you take the 7 and add your skill bonus (+1), resulting in an 8\. If your opponent is only able to passively defend themselves with no skill modifier, their defense is 5, so your **result** is (8-5=) **3**.

Whatever the sum of your roll minus the difficulty, that number is your **result**. If the sum is below 0, you have missed entirely. If it is 0-4, you have hit. Sometimes dealing damage is key, so hitting with a 0 is ineffective. If the sum is above 5, you have achieved a **breakthrough**. Different actions will have different consequences, so a breakthrough in dancing is not going to be anything like a breakthrough when hacking a security camera system, but the basic result is the same; you do exceptionally well.

### Consequences

Results give a miss (below 0), a hit with no damage (0), a hit with damage (1-4), or a breakthrough (5+). These results are interpreted differently based on the type of action being performed, but generally speaking, you can understand them as indicating that you failed, a degree of success from 0-4, or a major turn of events. Succeeding with a degree of success of 0 is weird, but often useful.

* If you want to harm someone, you could miss, hit them with a degree of success from 0-4, or really hit them well.  
* If you are looking for information about something, you could find nothing, find a lead that gets you 0-4 data points, or find a really great piece of intel.  
* If you are looking to subdue a spell, maybe you can’t do so at all, can hold it off for 0-4 rounds, or even end the spell entirely.

The Consequence of your check is not the number value, but the narrative thing that happens because of the check.

#### When the consequence of failure of your check should harm you, you are performing a **Save**. In this case, a negative result of 1-4 or 5 or less is interpreted as a minor or major condition respectively.

It is not solely the GM’s responsibility to arbitrate consequences, other players can also do so.  
Consequences can be conceptualized into the following six possible outcomes to help translate the results of the various mechanics back into narratives.

**Damage**  
Harming another creature or object, usually to impose a physical, social or magical condition on them. Can be achieved by physical violence, spells, insults, traps, and many other means.

**Intelligence**  
Learning or establishing something about a target or the world. Achieved through interrogation, augury, asking around, surveillance, and other methods.

**Initiative**  
Setting up a situation where you are in the same place as a target, with the intent of doing so with some particular advantages such as positioning. Achieved through many ways including reacting quickly, teleportation, demanding they meet you, or setting up an ambush.

**Social Change**  
Altering the status of your relationship with another creature or faction, or the esteem they have of you relative to another creature or faction. Can be achieved through many mechanisms not limited to sports, using enchantments, debating your merits, or uncovering intriguing gossip.

**Position Change**  
Moving, not relative to geography, but in relation to a target creature such as wrestling, possession, racing, etc. Each position type has many different approaches such as maneuvering quickly, magically binding, creating an illusion, or hiding.

**Location Change**  
Moving yourself and possibly other creatures and objects relative to the geography, sometimes within a certain time. This can be done by physically moving your target quickly, telekinesis, calling upon a porter, finding a shortcut, etc.

##### Challenges

Usually, one skill check is not all that’s needed to solve a problem or get through a situation. Challenges are these problems or situations that will likely need a few skill checks, about 3-4 from each player as a maximum. A challenge has a starting situation and a resolution, but they can be generated by any of the players, or taken directly out of official content, which includes interesting challenge ideas. 

#### **\[EXAMPLE\]**

Ultimately the difficulty of the game from a player point of view is governed by the number of challenges, as the game is balanced so that challenges gradually erode energy, social credit, supply and equipment until the party has very little to protect them from the inherent dangers of the world.

## 

## The Section Detailing the Basic Overview of Your Character {#the-section-detailing-the-basic-overview-of-your-character}

Your character is defined by three interconnected parts: their personality, their background, and their skills. None of these parts can be created in a vacuum, so it is impossible to generate a character without a context; both their party and the wider world.

### Personality

Your character’s personality includes the key features that identify and define them and are informed by the setting and your character’s background.

**Names** are key identifiers that also give us a place in society. Names are almost always given by others, and most cultures have important naming conventions that help situate you in your social groups.

**Physical Appearance** includes both anatomical data such as hair colour and cultural expressions such as hair style, both of which are often equally important.

**Auditory Cues** are used to facilitate role-play, make your character more memorable, and develop their upbringing and attitudes.

**Link to the Party** is a feature of all characters, including Player-Characters. It can include relationships, genealogy, social groupings, or simply commonalities that make you click with the party.

**Downtime Activities** help fill out your character and connect them to their skills, background and wider world. It’s also what you’re doing when you are caught unawares.

**Fate** is simultaneously how your character will exit the game, and also how they will level-up. How many times can you challenge your fate before it refuses to bend? Fate is usually presented as a mortal statement such as “I will die in a boxing match.”

### Background

Extensive, unique backgrounds are offered as setting-specific additions to published modules. They include suggestions on personality traits common to the background such as naming conventions of a certain society. They also include unique abilities granted only to those with the background, and access to additional abilities that can be learned or honed over your adventuring career regardless of their arena of play. These background abilities can, for example, give a fighter access to a spell or magical ability, or give a ranger access to an artistic talent or additional language. A starting background is found in the Appendix.

### Skills

Your character has 2 skills, which are deep, unique sets of proficiencies, abilities and context that drive the mechanics, personality and development of your character. Each skill belongs to one of the 4 Arenas of Play; martial, magic, factions or recon. You can choose two skills from the same arena. The skills themselves include starting proficiencies and abilities that are wide-ranging. There can be no exhaustive list of either skills or proficiencies, and overlaps and gaps are common. Skills often feature unique abilities found nowhere else in the game, but also make recommendations about more generic abilities within their arena of play. A selection of starting skills are found in the Appendix.

### Other Attributes

**Proficiencies** are defined by your background and skills. They are the things to which you can apply your proficiency bonus, and they are not bound by exhaustive lists or limitations on their definitions. You can be proficient in the use of all knives, or in understanding bird communications, or in navigating through forest terrain, or in navigating as long as you can see the moon. Each proficiency is a rule unto itself.  
**Bonuses**, whether skill, save, or proficiency are simply equal to your level. If you are level 4, your bonus is always \+4.  
**Passive Skill** is the ability you have to take on an action you are proficient with when you are not actively doing so, for example to walk over ice while you are actively scanning the horizon for danger, or to be aware of danger while you actively plod your way across the ice. It is always 5 \+ your proficiency bonus.  
**Energy** is used to buff your roll (take the higher dice), or to activate abilities. Because it’s used to buff your rolls and because you roll saves and active defenses, having no energy leaves you defenseless and more likely to suffer harm. When your energy is 0, you should flee. You can regenerate to half your energy by resting for an hour or completely regenerate it by resting for 8 hours.  
**Social Credit** is used like energy for faction interactions, buffing rolls and activating abilities.  
**Leveling Points** represent the limits on what your fate opens up to your character when they successfully challenge it. You get 2 when you level up (in addition to adding \+1 to your bonuses). You can use one levelling point to add a new ability from your background or skills, or to add a new proficiency, or to increase your max energy or max Social Credit by 1\.

# Chapter 2 : The “Martial” Arena Of Play, Dealing With Actions, Maneuvers, And Tactics {#chapter-2-:-the-“martial”-arena-of-play,-dealing-with-actions,-maneuvers,-and-tactics}

The Martial arena deals with the characters bodies in round table. Whether you are using it to move or act, if you are doing something primarily with you muscles, you are in the martial arena. It is fast-acting, working in seconds or fractions of seconds, but it is relatively limited in scope by the range of your arm’s reach, your standing leap, direct line-of-sight, and other physical limitations.

#### 

## The Section On Tactics, Covering Time Space And Actions Performed Therein {#the-section-on-tactics,-covering-time-space-and-actions-performed-therein}

### Tactical Challenges

Tactical challenges include discrete groups of actions and reactions that take a minute or less to complete that represent turning points or pivotal moments with the possibility of both success and failure, and significant impacts in both cases. Tactical challenges can often be used to represent key moments in longer events, or be set up by martial creatures and characters to create an inflection point to turn the tide of a larger event. For example, a sports game can be envisioned and played as either an hour-long strategic event, or a short set of 2-3 key tactical moments that define the result of the game, or even a combination of both. The same may be applied for such activities as scaling a cliff or engaging in a battle, or even finding a suitor at a ball or an entire dungeon crawl.  
These tactical challenges are played out in seconds culminating to a minute, usually broken down into 1-10 discrete rounds of a few seconds. A round is divided into opposing sides or teams. There can be anywhere from 1 to 4 or more sides depending on the nature of the challenge. Each side takes their turns together in whatever order the individuals on the side want. The order in which the sides take their turns is established by the initiative phase, as is the composition of the sides. Individuals on a side can move and act, declaring both their movement and their action, then resolving both before the next character’s turn. Once everyone on one side has taken a turn, the next side takes their turns.

### Range and Geometry

There are 4 tactical zones of range that originate at a creature; touch, short, medium, and long range.  
Touch is the area adjacent to the creature’s appendages. Some creatures have long appendages that can extend this range. Human touch extends to 1m on either side of the human, meaning the human’s touch range occupies a 2x2m area.  
Short range is the range that a creature can effectively control without relocating, through the use of “moving around”, lunging or leaping, polearms, and other implements. It is a small room, or a football (soccer) goal. Short range for humans is about 6x6m.  
Medium range is the range that a creature must orient their bodies (maneuver) to address, and the range that they can typically throw things. For humans, it is 10m, which is how far a human can hustle along in their turn, or how far they could be expected to accurately and effectively throw a rock or hammer.  
Long range is too far for a creature to consider covering in their turn. It is usually the entire tactical map past 20m. It is effectively irrelevant to a creature’s goals on their turn except that most ranged weapons are used at long range, and most creatures can use their primary senses at long range.  
Strategic range is explicitly non-tactical in nature. It covers 300m or more, allowing those with strategic rage capabilities to affect a tactical environment while effectively remaining outside it.

### Maneuvers

A maneuver is a discrete action that your body takes during a round, usually with the effect of moving from one place to another. A maneuver must be described as a single action such as “swim to shore”, and the effect of the maneuver is that your body is somewhere else at the end of your turn. Normally, you cannot use your maneuver to affect other creatures, however martial characters can use martial plays to make use of their maneuvers in novel ways.

Almost all creatures have a method of **Natural Movement** that represents their ordinary locomotion. Some creatures have several such modes of natural movement. Moving naturally over favorable terrain in clear conditions does not require a check or a save. For example a human can walk 10m over clear level terrain without a check, even while they are taking other actions.  
Other maneuvers might be considered natural movement, such as dropping from a ledge, standing up, opening and walking through a door, etc.

If it is possible for a creature to undertake a maneuver, they may be **Proficient or Non-proficient**. A human, for example, cannot possibly fly. It is not a question of proficiency. A human can possibly jump 4m, but there is a question of whether or not any given human is proficient at jumping because not all humans can naturally jump 4m. Proficient means you are specifically trained and knowledgeable about the maneuver at hand, and you add your skill bonus to your roll. Non-proficient means you can make the attempt, and there is some (even remote) possibility of success and failure. You roll without adding your skill bonus.  
When you determine proficiency, it is based on the entire maneuver you are undertaking. If you are not proficient at any single component of the maneuver, you are not considered proficient at the entire maneuver. It can be helpful to split up your maneuver over several turns, or to undertake non-proficient components as actions or abilities to avoid failing at the entire maneuver.

You can use your maneuver to **Move Recklessly**. This is to say undertake a maneuver that will cause harm if you fail. A maneuver is judged to be risky if any component of the maneuver is risky. If this is the case, the maneuver check instead becomes a save, meaning the result of the failure is interpreted as a corresponding amount of damage.

From the perspective of humans, the following types of terrain are commonly encountered that may represent a check, being unsure or a save, being downright dangerous.  
Checks:

* #### Squeezing through a slot smaller than a doorway, or squeezing around a cramped space such as a vehicle

* #### Scrambling up or down a steep slope or vertical drop smaller than the height of your outstretched arms.

* #### Scrambling across shifting terrain such as sand, snow, or gravel, on a watercraft, or on all fours across ice, mud or other slippery surfaces.

Saves:

* #### Dropping from or free climbing up or down a height more than double your own.

* #### Scrambling over furniture, debris, or other objects.

* #### Running, skidding or sliding across ice, uneven or unseen terrain, or steep slopes.

* #### Running through brush, slots smaller than doorways, or breakaway objects like paper walls.

* #### Running while taking an action counter to your maneuver such as wrestling, carrying more than your body weight, or putting on clothes.

You can also use your maneuver each round to do other things. Think of maneuvers as what you are doing with your body, and not your hands. If you would like to jump off a moving cart, or slide down a hill, or bodycheck your way through a door, these are maneuvers. All of these maneuvers would also require a check or save. You can also hide, fall prone, and do any of the maneuvers that your character has as martial plays.

##### Moving Around

You can use your maneuver to increase your reach to short range, allowing you to interact with any number of individuals or objects within a short distance (6m) from you more-or-less simultaneously. For example you might open a door, peek out a window, take something from an ally, and roll up a rug all within a the confines of a room. While the discrete movements of your body are complex, they all fall within the definition of “moving around”. You can also use moving around to react to creatures or objects entering or leaving that entire area with your reaction. In this way, as a reaction to whatever event you specified, you can move within your moving around area to the spot you specified. For example “if he comes closer I will back away” or “if he tries for either door I will block the one he’s trying.”

##### Taking Cover

You can use your maneuver to take cover, drop prone in tall grass, move out of cover to shoot and then back again, or move between cover that is within your movement range, and anything else that would result in you obscuring yourself from your enemies. While you are under cover you cannot be targeted by attacks or spells. Cover is not universal. Cover from one direction does not necessarily confer cover from another angle. Your GM may also require a check to be made to attain cover if you are trying to cover behind something smaller than you, or something that could be shot through like bushes or paper walls. A creature using their maneuver to take cover, move between cover, or shoot from cover is not under cover during their turn, only between their turns.

### Actions

Actions are what you are doing, mostly with your hands, to affect other creatures or objects on your turn, contrasted to maneuvers which largely only affect yourself and use your legs or whole body. Martial actions are things you are doing that require strength or dexterity to accomplish like tying a rope, passing a ball, lifting something, etc.  
You can use a weapon or other implement to physically **Attack** a creature or object. The resolution and consequences of attacks are covered in Chapter 6\.  
If you take a maneuver on your turn, you can use your action to **repeat the maneuver**. Thus you can move twice as far, try to jump a fence twice, drop off two separate ledges, etc. You usually can’t take two different maneuvers unless you have an ability that allows you to do so.  
There are a wide range of non-martial actions that can be taken in tactical time, such as spells with a casting time of one action, checks to know, observe or establish details of the locale or creatures there, and others. These other actions are detailed in the respective chapters covering their arena of play.

### Minor Actions

A minor action is something that you can do either simultaneously with a more complex action, or very quickly. Minor actions include things like dropping something, drawing a weapon, opening a door or peeking around a corner. You can usually only take one minor action on your turn.  
One of the most common minor actions is to **Communicate**. It might be useful to think of Maneuvers as what you are doing with your body, Actions as what you are doing with your hands, and Minor Actions as what you are doing with your mouth, but of course there are exceptions.

### Reactions

Unlike the rest of your actions and maneuvers, you take a reaction on someone else’s turn. The reaction generally takes a similar amount of time as a minor action, so you cannot take a full action such as an attack or casting a spell with a casting time of an action as your reaction. Instead, you will almost always be using your reaction to make a check or save against something that is happening to you on someone else’s turn.

Most commonly, you will be using your reaction in combat to make an **active defense** against an incoming attack. Rather than rely on your passive defense, you can use your reaction to make a check to totally annul an incoming attack by exceding the opponent’s roll. You can make this decision after you learn the opposing roll has defeated your passive defense.

You can also use your reaction to **Cooperate** with a team member by doing something on their turn such as handing them something.

You can only use one reaction per round, even if you are faced with multiple attacks or other checks, so choose wisely\!

## The Characteristics of Tactical Equipment, Including Weapons {#the-characteristics-of-tactical-equipment,-including-weapons}

### Weapon Characteristics

Weapons cause damage, detailed in the next section. They also have other features such length of melee weapons, effective range of ranged weapons and the following tags:

* #### **Reload** means you must take an action to reload before each shot, and expend one supply before you use the weapon each day.

* #### **Clip Reload** Allows you to reload only when you use rapid fire, not when you make regular attacks with the weapon in question. You expend one supply before you use the weapon each day.

* #### **Rapid Fire** Allows you to use your weapon to passively attack everything in a 2m area that you designate, as well as creatures passing through or leaving cover in the area for the next round.

* #### **Overkill** allows you to apply damage done to an object or vehicle to all the creatures covered by that object or inside the vehicle.

* #### **Chunky Salsa** If the area of effect of this weapon is enclosed on all but one side, or on all sides by a material that cannot be destroyed by the explosion, the damage from the explosion is contained within the available area, however it is doubled.

**Melee weapons** are either short, medium or long, referring to the physical length of the weapon itself.

* #### Short weapons like knives can be concealed, and used in a clinch or when squeezing, but not when riding a mount.

* #### Medium weapons cannot be concealed and cannot be used in a clinch or when squeezing but can be used mounted. 

* #### Long weapons are longer that the wielder is tall, cannot be concealed, or used in a clinch or squeezing, and are debuffed when used inside.

You cannot use **Ranged Weapons** while squeezing or in a clinch unless otherwise stated. They have the following effective ranges:

* #### Thrown weapons have a maximum effective range of 10m, unless otherwise specified. Once thrown, thrown weapons can be collected from the map after the combat as long as your side did not flee or hide to end combat.

* #### Short Range weapons are debuffed on attacks further than 10m within the locale.

* #### Long Range weapons have a range that crosses an entire locale.

* #### Strategic Range weapons are long range, but can also be used to make attacks into a locale from outside it.

### Armour and Damage

After you calculate whether or not a weapon attack hits, you add weapon damage to the result, subtract damage reduction of armour, and are left with a result that is interpreted into a minor or critical condition. Attacks are detailed in the chapter on Consequences, and Conditions are detailed in the chapter on Advanced Rules.  
The important factor here is that weapons have a damage rating, and armour has a damage reduction rating.  
Statistically speaking, a weapon that adds 3 or more damage turns most hits lethal. These are lethal weapons. Some weapons are designed specifically to do less harm such as sports implements, and therefore have a negative damage modifier, being non-lethal weapons. Weapons dealing 5 or more extra damage are so powerful they cannot be expected to hit without grievous injury or death, and can sometimes cause harm by narrowly missing, meaning even armour becomes ineffective. This means armour ratings are typically 3 or below, eliminating the danger of some lethal weapons but not all.  
We are therefore presented with a spectrum  
From \-2 up to \+6 damage for weapons, with \+1 and \+2 weapons being common harmful tools and small weapons, and \+3 and \+4 being extremely dangerous lethal weapons, and \+5 and \+6 being devastating military weaponry.  
Conversely, sports equipment, heavy clothing, and other common protective items are \-1 damage reduction, light military armour being \-2, heavy duty protection being \-3.  
Equipment lists will specify both damage ratings and damage reduction for weapons and armour, these guides are just to provide some idea of the range involved. Naturally some items like miniguns and full plate armour might exceed the values given here.

## The Entire List of Martial Plays to Bootstrap the Game {#the-entire-list-of-martial-plays-to-bootstrap-the-game}

### Maneuvers

All plays take 1 energy to perform.  
Maneuvers are integral to a martial character turning the tide in a challenge. Recon and faction-based characters can often set up ambushes, traps, and terrain obstacles that would leave the party helplessly exposed. Through incredible feats of physicality and acrobatics, martial characters can eschew these disadvantages and turn any battlefield into a killing floor. Martial characters also use maneuvers when mounted to make the most of their mount’s abilities.

#### **Mobile Attack**

Make an attack as a component of your maneuver, making two attacks if you use your action to double your maneuver.

#### **Bullrush**

Pass through opponents as a component of your maneuver, forcing them to save against your passive martial skill or fall prone.

#### **Bully**

Use your maneuver to close in, push, and generally harass an opponent as a belligerent action. They are considered to be in a clinch with you and you can make an attack with this maneuver to either cause the *afraid* or *angry* condition.

#### **Control the Line of Attack**

As your maneuver, make an attack against an adjacent opponent to move them as if you were in a clinch without touching them.

#### **Mounting Expert**

You can get onto a mount or a vehicle or platform as natural movement even if they are moving. You can also expend 1e in an initiative phase to change your position relative to a mount, vehicle or platform (ie mounting, dismounting, getting in or out, etc).

#### **Parkour**

Make any number of saves against reckless movement with a single reaction. You may be able to use your parkour ability to defend against checks meant to encounter you.

#### **Roughrider**

From a grappling position of control, you can expend 1e as a maneuver to mount an unwilling mount which you can thereafter ride as long as you stay in grappling control.

### Actions

Martial characters are able to take advantage of their turn in ways other characters cannot, especially through increasing the number and variety of actions they can take.  
Remember that all martial plays use one energy.

#### **Choke, Lock, Break**

# Chapter 3 : The “Magic” arena of play, dealing with all things arcane {#chapter-3-:-the-“magic”-arena-of-play,-dealing-with-all-things-arcane}

Magic is a major component of Round Table, intended to be used for creative and lateral problem solving. The magic system can be somewhat difficult to master, and the possibilities of any given spell are often not apparent at first glance.

#### 

## 

## The Section Detailing Magic, its Characteristics and Uses {#the-section-detailing-magic,-its-characteristics-and-uses}

### Magic Checks

Magic checks are taken when a creature interacts directly with magical energy. Like all other checks, the creature attempting to initiate a change will roll 2d12 and take the lower result. You can use energy to buff magic check, which is the same energy that is used to buff martial checks, as in Round Table ordinary physical energy is responsible for enacting magic rather than a reserve of some other form of personal energy reserve.  
As with the other arenas of play, a creature targeted by magic can actively resist by making a check themselves, and a check that would result in harm if failed is known as a save.

Consider whether or not a given spell effect grants the caster or the target a new **Natural Ability**. Any abilities granted by spells, such as a new movement speed or sense, are considered natural abilities, and don’t require checks or saves to use in their ordinary intended sense, unlike skills. The ability is likely limited, for example a new sense probably only extends to the range or the area of effect, but within that area you can use it without thinking and without rolling, and you can do so with abilities that are far beyond what a human could normally aspire to.

**For Example**, if you grant a martial character the ability to see and touch the ethereal, they can use their ordinary combat abilities against ethereal creatures, because they are now considered naturally able to do everything needed to fight ethereals.  
If a spell effect would clearly **Cause Harm** to a creature, you can use it like an attack. You can also create a passive effect using your passive magic skill that would impose a debuff or save on those affected. Remember, a failed save deals its remainder in damage, so in this way spells can cause harm as well. In order to use an active attack roll you need to target a creature, while areas of effect are required to use passive effects. The specific condition created by the spell might be detailed in its description, otherwise it is up to the table.

### The Characteristics of Spells

All major arcanum are spells, whereas only the minor arcanum that include descriptions of the following characteristics are spells.

#### Casting Time

The amount of time it takes to cast the spell. During this time, unless the spell requires an altar, you must maintain focus on the spell. If your focus is broken, the spell ends.  
You are considered to have expended the energy requirements of a spell when you start casting it.  
The spell is cast the moment the casting time ends, so if the casting time is one minute or longer, the spell may be difficult to use in tactical encounters like combat. You may have to time the actions of your party to correspond with your casting time. You can use an initiative point to take an action to cast a spell. The casting times are as follows:

* Reaction  
* Action  
* Minute  
* 10 Minutes  
* 1 Hour  
* 1 Day

#### Components

Spells use different components to be cast, being focus, material, or altar components. Each component type may be desirable for its own reasons, and some spells may stipulate that they use multiple component types simultaneously, for example an altar to cast the spell and a number of materials per target.

* #### Focus you must use a focus object, a type of magical equipment, to concentrate on the spell and target for the entire casting time and duration as your action. If you lose the ability to sense the target, or to take an action to maintain focus, or someone succeeds at a check against you with the goal of breaking your focus, the spell ends entirely.

* #### Material means you must use spell materials to cast the spell, however you do not need to maintain focus on the spell during its casting time or duration. Only targets within range are affected, but the spell does not end if the targets or the caster leave the range or hide.

* #### Altar means you must use a tier-appropriate altar to cast the spell. This is usually in the possession of a faction. Altars cannot be moved and they can only be sanctified by factions. Only targets within range are affected, but the spell does not end if the targets or the caster leave the range. The caster must remain within the range while casting a spell, but does not need to focus for the casting time or duration.

#### 

#### 

#### Duration

This is how long the spell remains in effect from the moment the casting time is over. The duration can be cut short if the spell ends, for example if it requires focus that is lost, or is interrupted by abjuration. Duration times follow the same pattern as casting times: 

* Reaction  
* Action  
* Minute  
* 10 Minutes  
* 1 Hour  
* 1 Day

#### Relation

Spells can be seen as harmful or beneficial, impolite, strange, horrifying, terrorizing, gallant, and many other adjectives. The relation characteristic of a spell is how it is received by those affected by the spell using the categories of faction relations detailed in the factions chapter. Relations will affect how easy it is to request that someone perform a spell on your behalf, and the social impact of casting spells in public as well as private. If you are seen turning someone’s blood to ash, you may be a saint or a terrorist depending on the circumstances and faction relations, but at least you have a handy tag to let you know it’s hostile. The relation characteristic of the spell is meant to apply to the use of the spell described in the text. It may not suit a particular use case, for example using a spell tagged as “hospitable” to ultimately cause harm to the targets, would not be hospitable after all. A spell can fall into any of the relations statuses:

* Hostile  
* Belligerent  
* Indifferent  
* Hospitable  
* Benevolent  
* Dedicated

#### Targets

This is the number of individuals affected by the spell in the way the spell describes when it mentions “targets”. Targets must be selected by the spell caster, so the caster must be able to target an object or creature. Creatures that are under cover, or otherwise not available to the primary sense of the caster cannot be targeted. This applies to both beneficial and harmful effects. If the spell requires focus, it can be ended on a target by obscuring the target such that they can no longer be targeted, thus taking cover from such a spell is an effective defense.  
A caster can always target themselves, even if they are blinded. A spell effect will usually specify that it targets creatures or objects exclusively. If it doesn’t specify, you can target either. The number of targets can be any whole number.

#### Energy

Casting spells is hard work. It takes a mental and physical toll on the caster represented by an energy cost that is expended at the beginning of the casting time. On average, characters start with 3 energy, so many major arcanum are not accessible to level 1 characters simply because of their energy cost, which is often 5 for Major Arcanum. Energy is not exclusively magical in nature, it is the same biochemical energy that people use to run or think.

#### Range

This is the distance between the edge of the caster’s hand or square in a combat grid, and the centre of the spell’s effect. If the spell also has an area, this means it is centred at the end of the range or closer. If the range is being calculated to a target, this means that the number of squares (or meters) between caster and target must be less than or equal to the range.  
Spells are considered to travel in a straight line without being blocked by physical objects If a target is being targeted through reflections or other means, the range does not take the path of the targeting sense into account.  
If the range is touch, a caster’s attempt to touch an unwilling target is considered part of the spell’s checks or saves, they do not need to make an additional attack check.  
The max range is set when you create the spell, however when you cast it you can choose to cast it at a shorter range. The range can be any whole number in meters, however official content usually follows these categories:

* Touch/0m  
* 2m  
* 10m  
* Locale/100m  
* Strategic/500m

#### Area

This is the side length of a square in which the spell takes place. The spell can be any symmetrical geometric shape within the area such as a triangle, square, donut or pentagon. You choose the shape of the area when you create the spell. remember, the range reaches to the centre of the area, so in order to make a cone that projects 10m from the caster’s finger tips, your range must be at least 5m. You cannot choose to alter the geometry of the area when you cast the spell, but you can generally cast a spell such that the area is placed exactly as you intend, hitting some targets while missing others, if this is possible. Area can be any whole number of meters but is generally expressed in these categories:

* Touch/0m  
* 2m  
* 4m  
* 10m  
* Locale/100m

### School of Magic

Many spells, and some creatures, skills, abilities and other parts of the game may explicitly impact schools of magic, for example buffing or debuffing spells cast from these schools. The schools of magic are socially constructed categories of how the magic functions, where it comes from, and its effects, so they do not correspond perfectly with any of these constraints. A spell that is created by a similar process to an evocation, but which causes materials to transform for the purpose of damaging constructs (for example heating certain alloys), may in fact be categorized as a transmutation, because it alters materials and is particularly effective against constructs, and the actual energies involved are secondary to the effect. For the benefit of simplified gameplay, these effects and functionalities are categorized into schools of magic. Players and characters can use the language of the schools of magic to study and understand them more easily, while at its core there is a single poorly understood magical energy system that underpins the Round Table universe.

**Abjuration** is the school of magic that deals with magical energy directly, the "veil" of magical energy that appears to permeate the entire universe, and meta-knowledge of the functionality of magic. In practical terms, abjuration is most obvious to the average person in the use of anti-magic such as talismans and wards, which are very commonly employed across all levels of society. They usually convert any other spells back into abstract arcane energy, dissipating the effects, and this is the extent of knowledge the average person might have over Abjuration. Whether for better or worse, powerful abjurers must come to a more profound understanding of the nature of magic and the 'veil' of magical energy all around us. Once they achieve this understanding, they can read, interpret, or otherwise come to understand magic, spells, creatures and devices in ways ordinary people cannot comprehend. Soon, their manipulation of pure magical energy allows them to shift, or even pierce the "veil", banishing or summoning extraplanar creatures, or even traveling between planes. Abjuration is often therefore misunderstood as pertaining only to defensive wards, or being the school of "pure wizardry," with terrifying, mind-bending possibilities.

**Divination** deals with the encoding, reading and storing of information within the veil of magic that permeates the universe. Practically speaking, most people dabble or experience divination in the case of minor predictions, advice, or insights into themselves or their immediate surroundings. Parlour tricks such as palm reading, or reading the history of artifacts from their surface are common. Diviners who plumb the depths of this field will find that aside from simply reading or predicting minor and inconsequential local events, they can extend their perception far beyond the local, both physically and metaphysically. After that, they will come around to understand that the field of divination is not all that it seems, as they soon become capable of secreting away information, or even altering the veil to obscure or simply misrepresent the signs that lesser diviners accept as facts.  
**Enchantment** is the perception or alteration of the emotional states of semi-intelligent or intelligent beings. Because all being exist within the context of a magical universe, magic runs through their minds, even if they are not essentially magical creatures. Many societies write volumes to justify or categorize "good" and "evil" enchantments, and enchantments are often considered as hostile as physical violence. In fact, enchanting someone without consent is usually criminal, and physical violence is considered to be a wise form of defense from enchanters. Simple tricks and cons are the most common form of enchantments, but those who study the field in depth will come to radical understandings of the self, society, the mind, and their own humanity that will set them apart. For good or evil, they will be capable of quickly and effectively destroying or re-building a person without any need for the dirty game of combat.

**Evocation** is the conversion between the arcane and the physical. Often pursued for its incredible potential, the physical limitations of the universe at once appear stalwart, yet fragile. Most commonly, evocation converts a small amount of arcane energy into a physical form such as sound, to create a bang, or a tiny amount of heat. Many people are underwhelmed by these tricks of lighting a candle, but some see that an enormous climate-altering forest fire starts from nothing but a precisely placed candle flame. Those who come to master evocation can learn to directly cause somewhat strong physical energies to manifest, even telekeneisis, small fire spouts, deafening bangs, and other, stranger effects. They may also come to understand the world of the elementals, machines, and constructs, allowing them to use energy to strongly manipulate such things. Perfecting evocation usually involves both an understanding of the magic, and an understanding of the physical world to set off chain reactions that are millions of times more powerful than an individual's action.

Every living thing contains **Life Magic**. In fact, there is a strong argument in the world of Round Table that an essential component of the definition of life is its association with magical energies. Beyond simple chemical reactions, there is magic happening in all life forms. Usually, healing magic is a source of both relief and anxiety in larger society, for all the same reasons that the medical professions are highly esteemed, but also extremely regulated. Beyond the common and highly regarded life-saving abilities of healers, there is a course of dangerous and hideous research, and sitting tantalizingly close to life is death and undeath; the persistence of a creature through life magic without the need for a physical form. It can and has been said by some that any form of life magic is evil necromancy, even if the ends are good, the means are unjustifiable.

The change of one substance into another from simple evaporation to the metamorphosis of a butterfly is incredible. The use of arcane energy to promote such transformation is **Transmutation**. The most common transmutations are mindless to common folk. Rituals to ensure bread has a flaky crust are cast off as mundane. Specialist skills to create porcelaine, or mythical metals are usually what common people actually associate with transmutation, and of course the legends and insane reaches of transmutation to create constructs or transform lead into gold could be possible, or not. A simple baker may never know.

## The Definitions of Magical Equipment That You Might Come Across in the Worlds  {#the-definitions-of-magical-equipment-that-you-might-come-across-in-the-worlds}

Magic tools are very useful, sometimes completely necessary, for the use of spells, especially Major Arcanum. Some Major Arcanum spells use so much energy, or are so limited that they must be used in conjunction with magic tools to be made very effective, while others can be transformed through the proper use of powerful tools from trivial parlor tricks to legendary powers.  
The following general guides will help you understand how the respective magic tools are used, however the tools themselves, their specific functions and values are found in equipment lists in official content.  
Unless otherwise specified, magic tools cannot be destroyed by mortal means.

### Wands, Rods and Staves

These are long, slender implements made of magically conductive materials that allow a caster to focus their energies more precisely, conferring bonuses for spells with targets, especially a single target. For example, they might allow someone to increase the range of a single target spell.

### Scrolls and Tablets

Whether they are stone tablets, parchment, floppy discs, or any other material, a scroll is a portable instance of a spell containing instructions for its use. Any character who knows a Major Arcanum can cast it into the scroll, which can then be used by anyone proficient with scrolls. Each scroll has a casting time to access their stored spells. While it is in the scroll, it is inaccessible to the original caster, however if they die their spell may persist, thus scrolls can be found empty or already loaded. Unlike almost any other magic item, scrolls can be destroyed by ordinary means.

### Books and Cards

Spell books allow those proficient in their use to copy extensive notes and magical formulas into their pages, transforming them into an indestructible magical items and allowing their owners to cast the Major Arcanum contained within as if they were using an altar. Spell codices are written in a code unique to their owners, and are not usable to anyone else without learning the code. Decks of magical cards contain shorthand notes and enchantments that work just like spell books.

### Rings, Crowns and Chains

Rings, Crowns and Chains are specialized items that allow their wearer to focus their energies inward, augmenting spells that target the caster. Examples of the effects of these items might be that they reduce casting time or energy for spells targeting the caster, or increase the area of effect on spells cast with a range of touch.

### Chronometers

All chronometers are complex machines that allow the caster to stretch the time between casting and spell effect. Pocket watches allow the caster to release the effect with the click of its button. Digital watches additionally allow the caster to release the effect in the location that the spell was cast, even if the caster is no longer there (they must be within range). Egg-watches are small construct computers that can be instructed to release the effect under certain triggers, even if the caster is out of range and cannot sense the triggers.

### Prisms

Crystals, dice, orbs and all other geometric devices are used to focus, refract and amplify arcane energy. Spells’ areas of effect or number of targets can be augmented, for example a triangular prism may allow the caster to automatically include two other people in any spell targeting the caster, or an orb might increase the range of any spell with an area of effect.

## What Are the Minor Arcanum and the List of Generic Ones {#what-are-the-minor-arcanum-and-the-list-of-generic-ones}

Minor Arcanum are abilities that an individual can train that allow them to manipulate magic in new and interesting ways. Minor arcanum function identically to all other abilities, you earn them using levelling points, and once learned you can apply them wherever they make sense.

## The Section Dealing with the Major Arcanum and Their Examples {#the-section-dealing-with-the-major-arcanum-and-their-examples}

Major arcanum are powerful spells that require a very restrictive amount of energy. Major arcanum are learned in the same way that minor arcanum are, however their availability is much more limited. You only have the opportunity to spend levelling points to acquire individual major arcanum as your character discovers them and adventures to acquire them. There is no master list of major arcanum, they are released through official content in a similar manner to equipment lists.

Additionally, every affected creature in the area feels that you are physically or magically perceiving them directly, searching them, possibly scrying their thoughts. This may cause hidden creatures to give up hiding or creatures hiding things to act erratically. You and your allies are buffed when using this spell to investigate, interrogate or gather information.

###### **Sense Energy \[Evocation\]**

CASTING TIME: Ten Minutes  
COMPONENTS: Material  
DURATION: One Hour  
Relation: Benevolent  
TARGETS: One  
Energy: 5  
RANGE: touch  
AREA: 100m  
Targets can sense the existence and intensity of a selected physical energy in the area within range such as heat, light, sound etc. They can sense if energy sources are flowing or moving through the area and can designate targets as if this sense was their primary natural sense, for example targeting “the hottest object in the room.” They can sense extremely low energy levels, sensing clearly in near perfect darkness, silence or cold. If targets of this spell are *blinded* after casting the spell, this spell ends instead.

Duration: One Minute  
Relation: Belligerent  
Targets: None  
Energy: 3

Creatures saving or actively defending against the energy type you selected who are within the area and duration can use your proficiency bonus instead of theirs. Targets cannot be selected into, within, or out of the area using the energy type you selected for the duration.  
Spikes in the energy type, such as a hot object or bright flash are diffused over time and space to be effectively eliminated. Energy from ordinary sources such as a flashlight or shout do not cross the area, but may be perceived as being within the area even though they cannot be precisely located.

Targets: 3  
Energy: 6  
Range: Touch  
Area: 6m  
After the casting time, you must touch each target within the duration and area with a spell component, which is then consumed. At the end of the duration, a bolt of energy is instantaneously discharged between the targets that are still within the area, constituting a magic attack against them causing the immobilized/paralyzed condition. The act of touching the targets is not inherently hostile until the spell takes effect, however it is clearly part of a spell casting.

###### **Lifelight \[Life Magic\]**

Casting Time: One Minute  
Components: Material  
Duration: One Hour  
Relation: Hospitable  
Targets: One  
Energy: 3  
Range: Touch  
Area: None  
The target is surrounded by a faint light, buffing checks and saves to heal physical and magical conditions or against possession by undead for the duration. Additionally, when you cast this spell you can make a check to expel any undead possessing the target. The faint light causes undead to save against the afraid/panicked condition whenever they first perceive it.

###### **Sympathetic Touch \[Life Magic\]**

Casting Time: One Hour  
Components: Material  
Duration: Instantaneous  
Relation: Devoted  
Targets: 4  
Energy: 5  
Range: Touch  
Area: None  
When you begin casting this spell, you will take on a number of conditions corresponding to the number of spell components used, to the maximum of the spell’s target number that the creature you are touching is suffering from. You retain these conditions for the casting time, and indefinitely if the spell is not completed successfully. Otherwise, both you and the origin of these target conditions are relieved of them at the end of the casting time. If you take on a condition such as paralyzed, which would prevent you from completing the spell, you retain the condition but do not complete the spell.

###### **Slip/Stick \[Transmutation\]**

Casting Time: One Minute  
Components: Material  
Duration: One Minute  
Relation: Indifferent  
Targets: None  
Energy: 3  
Range: Touch  
Area: 10m  
Cause every solid surface of objects not carried or worn by creatures in the area to become either slick or sticky. This makes maneuvers across the area risky by default, and may impose your magic skill save on various actions such as opening doors. You can make a check to have this spell affect the surfaces of a target construct within the area or deal damage to it.

###### **Quicken/Thicken \[Transmutation\]**

Casting Time: One Minute  
Components: Focus  
Duration: One Minute  
Relation: Indifferent  
Targets: None  
Range: Touch  
Area: 6m   
You make a specified liquid in the area not in direct contact with non-construct creatures more or less viscous for the duration. This will make maneuvers across the area risky for creatures that are naturally suited to swimming through the ordinary viscosity of the liquid. You can use this spell to directly damage machines and constructs that rely on the liquid being a specific viscosity (cars and oil, for example), or creatures that rely on the ambient liquid for survival (fish and water, for example) if they remain inside the area for the entire duration.

###### **Congeal/Unseal \[Transmutation\]**

Casting Time: One Hour  
Components: Material  
Duration: Instantaneous  
Relation: Belligerent  
Targets: Two  
Range: Touch  
Area: None  
Adhere two objects together, or make a check to repair an object. Alternatively, you can dissolve any glue without a check, or make a check to break welds, magic seals or any other bond between two objects. This spell cannot be used to unseal things stuck together by the very same spell. When the spell ends, the objects are not considered to be magically bonded (it cannot be dispelled), but nor is there any physical glue present. You can use this spell as an attack against constructs and objects that require tight seals like pressure vessels or mobility like wheels. You cannot unscrew, unlatch, or otherwise move mechanisms with this spell.

# **Chapter 4 :** The “Factions” Arena of Play Dealing with Interpersonal, Group and Societal Dynamics {#chapter-4-:-the-“factions”-arena-of-play-dealing-with-interpersonal,-group-and-societal-dynamics}

Those skilled with the arts of diplomacy will use their faction skills and the assets of their allied factions to make a difference in their daily activities. Faction characters use hour-long strategic actions to wrangle support, investigate, or even attack enemies through the complicated spider web of faction relations.  
Unlike martial skills, which focus on the tactical realm and physical movement, faction skills rely on negotiation, intimidation, investigation and persuasion, but none of that matters if you don’t know who you’re dealing with, or they don’t know to be afraid of you. 

### Faction Checks

Faction checks operate just like checks from the other 3 arenas, and like checks from those other arenas, they have some idiosyncrasies. Like the other arenas, you need to be able to target a creature to make a faction check against them. In the case of faction checks you must also be able to communicate with them. You roll 2d12, and subtract your opponent’s passive or active defense, applying buffs or debuffs as necessary. The result can be applied as damage incurring a social condition, initiative points when establishing an encounter, intel points, success or failure, or any other result relevant to the particular challenge you are facing.

### Social Credit

In addition to supply and GP, there is a currency specific to the Factions arena of play that can be converted to leverage, assets, and the other currencies. Social Credit represents your overall charisma, social graces, inherited place in society, and legendary status. No one of these things completely trumps the other, and a beautiful or eloquent person may be taken more seriously than a high-ranking official. The specifics of how any individual character derives their Social Credit is up to their player, but mechanically you can use one levelling point to permanently acquire one additional maximum Social Credit that may represent your increasing cunning, renown, gravitas, or whatever you like. Social Credit is regained to your maximum after completing a long rest.

### Personal Assets

In addition to faction assets detailed below and in official content, an individual might buy, inherit, win or otherwise acquire a personal asset. This is a major item such as an estate or dedicated followers that is not tied to a faction and can be accessed by the individual at any time. To acquire a personal asset, the character must go through the acquisition challenge detailed below, however the cost of the asset in addition to the GP cost is one levelling point. The asset both costs and represents an achievement in faction skills in the sense that it is a considerable personal fortune. In many cases, the outright and unrestricted ownership of an asset as an individual is uncommon and unnecessary as they are readily available as faction assets, so the acquisition of a personal asset represents independence and the value of an individual to a faction. For example, in a modern context many people own both cars and homes, however few people own and maintain these assets outright and independently.  
Once a character has a personal asset, they can access it at any time without making a acquisition check or spending Social Credit. It is assumed to be relatively self-sustaining, however you can always choose to be maintaining that asset as a downtime activity.

## That Page Where All The Faction Relations Are Listed {#that-page-where-all-the-faction-relations-are-listed}

#### 

| Relation | Description | Actions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Hostile | Willing to kill you, unwilling to allow you to succeed, seeks ways to take risks to harm you. | Attack with the intent of killing, harm your allies |
| Belligerent | Willing to harm you, unwilling to allow you to pass unnoticed, will harm you with limited risk. | Attack to capture, impose conditions or damage equipment. Shout, argue, and stalk you. |
| Indifferent | Unwilling to help, willing to help those who would harm you. | Bar you from leaving, point you out, remove you from aid. |
| Hospitable | Willing to help without risk. | Accept you into their private space, trade with you, hold something for you, stay quiet for you. |
| Benevolent | Willing to take small risks to help you, unwilling to help your opponents. | aid you in combat (unless they are targeted), give you something worth 1GP or less, heal you |
| Dedicated | Willing to risk their life for you, considers your interests as their own. | Fight for you, give you something worth more than 1GP. |

It is very unusual for creatures to be **Hostile** to one another. It means they intend to kill you and are currently seeking a way to do that. Most of your opponents are not truly hostile. Having any hostile opponents is an unusual and imminent threat that you should resolve quickly.

Normally, when opposed, creatures are considered **Belligerent**. Someone willing to fight you or break your things is as dangerous and violent as most people are willing to get.

An **Indifferent** person or organization is perfectly contented to see you fail. This relation is usually held by people who are untrusting and suspicious by nature, or have some reason to believe you are not benefitting society.

The usual relation people and organizations have with insiders and “normal” people in society is **Hospitable**. A merchant is being hospitable merely by offering trade, so the vast majority of random people can usually be considered hospitable.

The normal relation that one has with friends and family is **Benevolent**. They operate on a principle of offering and expecting basic levels of aid and accommodations. This is also the relation you have with factions you add through levelling points.

**Dedicated** is a special relation that one usually only shares with a few people in their entire life. You are willing to risk your life for this person and consider your wealth to be shared. This is the relation that a character asset has to you.

### 

### Relations

Relations are the actions we take concerning another entity, whether it’s a faction or an individual. While attitudes and mannerisms are important to role-play, the mechanics of the game concern the actions that are taken, which can sometimes be in striking contrast to the words and sentiments that are expressed.  
Relations are unilateral, they describe how one entity acts toward another. Relationships are the sum of the relations between two or more entities. With only 6 categories of relations and the ability to dip into and borrow from neighboring relations, a near-infinite number of relationships might exist concerning any number of entities.  
Your table can establish the relations you have with an individual or group based on the sum of recent interactions as well as social expectations. Similarly to an inventory call, establishing a relations category is not always important for everyday gameplay, and can usually be done at the start of a relationship or whenever it becomes important to the rules and mechanics of the game. Look at the Relations below to get an idea of the sorts of things that might indicate that your relations might be in one category or another.

##### Enacting Relations

Anything clearly defined as part of your relations status with an individual or group, or anything that is not defined but your table agrees on, takes only an action, not a check. For example, asking a hospitable person to allow you to hide in their car does not require a check. Trying to do something that is one step outside your current relations status does require a faction check, for example asking someone who is hospitable to your target to reveal that they are hiding in the car requires a check to try to make them act indifferent to their guest by giving them up.  
You can enact relations in whatever way you think is most beneficial. For example, you might argue that someone is benevolent to you, so revealing the target hiding in their car falls within your expectations regardless of their relationship with that hiding person. In this case you do not check against the beneficial person, instead it is a faction contest between you and the hiding person to see who can convince the person caught in the middle to help them.  
The result of a challenge might end up with someone acting in a way that is out of line with your expectations. For example, you ask a benevolent ally to reveal the location of someone who is hiding, the hiding person wins the challenge, so the benevolent person refuses to reveal them (thus acting indifferently toward you). This gives you the green light to normalize indifference between you, but it’s up to you to decide if that’s really what you want.

##### Single Actions and Out of Line

You may use leverage and make a check to convince someone to take on a single action of a category above your current relations status, or make a save to recover from undertaking an action that is beneath your expected relations. For example, you may find a valuable trinket but discover the owner is indifferent. Use leverage and a check to try to convince them to undertake the hospitable act of allowing you to buy it. By contrast, you may turn a stranger away in a storm, unsure of whether you should have acted hospitably or indifferently, you make a save against a social condition as you are plagued with anxiety about your choice.

##### Unilateral Changes

These are changes where you are attempting to alter the relations status that a target has with another entity, for example convincing someone to be benevolent to you, or convincing someone to be hostile to another faction. This is not the same as convincing someone to take a single action that would be considered part of the target category.  
This is a graduated check. The first time you make the check, the effect lasts for 1 minute. You must make another check to make it last for 10 minutes, then 1 hour, and so on. The check itself is also graduated in time, taking 1 minute the first time, then 10 minutes and so on, unless you have additional leverage or other ways to alter the check so it can be done more quickly as per the usual rules on graduated checks.

##### Multilateral Changes

Multilateral diplomacy checks are checks to normalize relations and expected behavior. You will know the current relations status and the expectation, for example if an individual is acting indifferent toward you but because of faction relations they are meant to be acting benevolent. You can then make a single faction check to adjust your relations to all match the expectation.  
In order to do this, you must have also adopted the behaviors of the expected relations status. For example, if you are engaged in hostile combat with someone and wish to normalize to expected indifference, you must stop attacking them and tell your allies to leave them alone, then you can make a single faction check to move their relations with you to indifferent.  
The multilateral change takes 1 minute and is permanent.

### Leverage

Leverage overcomes the inertia of social interactions. Most people tend to want to keep things as they are, and are mildly averse to making things different, so there needs to be a certain amount of leverage to get things moving socially. You need to use leverage to get someone to take an action that is one step outside their current relations status. For example, to convince someone who is hospitable toward you to give you 5 supply, or to convince someone who is indifferent toward a 3rd party to throw a rock at them.  
You can use a character’s relation to your party or their fate as leverage if you know it and it is suitable. Otherwise you can expend 1 Social Credit to get things moving purely on your good standing in the community. Barring that, 1 supply is enough to grease the wheels. Some characters have additional ways to exercise leverage from their background, skills or abilities. However you have used leverage, if you make the same check again using the same leverage, you must make a graduated check, meaning it takes longer for each time you do it. You can reduce complicated faction checks from hours to minutes simply by diversifying the ways you exercise leverage.

## Factions As Entities Consisting of Characters and Assets {#factions-as-entities-consisting-of-characters-and-assets}

Factions are groups of humanoids that have collectivized and shared many of their economic and social needs, thus creating a cohesive group of people who have vested interests in their mutual security and success. Factions therefore form an integral part of interacting with humanoids, as even if you can physically overpower an individual, they have collectivized their personal security such that you must first (or later) overcome their faction’s collective power. Furthermore, as an individual, you do not need to rely as heavily in your own personal abilities to overcome the environment, magical threats or physical dangers if you are seen as an integral contributing member of a faction.  
Factions can form for a great number of reasons, but as an individual character, your interaction with them is mostly focused around acquiring Social Credit, which is a faction currency that you can exchange for use of their assets.  
Details about specific factions are offered in official content modules. They include information such as the assets that the faction holds, the types of locales it operates in, its expectations, and its relations with other factions.

### Operations

Factions only operate in certain regions, and usually only certain locales within those regions. For example a gang might only operate in a certain country, and only in gang-held enclaves within that country. Outside of these areas, they exist, however their powers are much more limited. You can usually only access assets in regions where the faction operates, and can only rely on their complete control in their specialized locales. For example, in a locale dominated by a faction, a character can get in touch with a representative of the faction freely and can assume that at least a few identifiable characters in the locale will be faction members, and can establish any faction characters they might like in the locale.

### Membership 

Any character can be loosely affiliated with other members of a faction through narrative or role-play, but they are not considered to be an official member unless they have used one levelling point to adopt official membership into that faction. In this way, faction membership is a type of personal asset.  
Membership immediately grants the benefits of the faction’s relations with other members (always benevolent) and other factions as well as the benefit of being able to access the faction’s assets through social credit.

### Expectations

Factions have norms of behavior and expectations. Usually these are fairly relaxed and well-known. Even if there is a complex series of punishments related to infractions, such a system is there to allow for the infractions to be made and then rectified all while the individual remains a member of the faction. Your table establishes most of the expectations that a faction has.  
You don’t need play mechanically through parking tickets, you can just role-play whether your character is the type of person to get parking tickets or to find legal parking. They are still a member of a faction even if they routinely ignore minor infractions. You are expected to act benevolently toward the representatives of your faction and it would be out-of-line to fail to do so, however it would take significantly more concerted effort and harm to actually be expelled from your faction.  
The ways you can get expelled from your faction are usually specifically defined in their expectations. If you are permanently expelled from your faction (this is always the choice of player), you can re-assign your levelling point to a different faction.  
If a character fails to meet the expectations of a faction, usually presenting as a character failing to act benevolently to other faction members or contravening a major rule, they may be **suspended**. Their access to faction assets is cut off until they normalize relations with a leader, usually by offering a benevolent service to that leader.  
If a player does not want their character to be a member of a faction any more, they can pursue **expulsion** from a faction. Undertaking a narrative arc of betrayal, self-discovery, or some other journey, they will disentangle themselves from the faction and reallocate their faction membership to a different faction.

### Relations

Faction relations are the norm between individuals of either faction. You can use them to try to achieve a multilateral change to relations with another individual and to expect how an individual will react to you and your actions. 

### Assets

One of the primary reasons for forming a faction is to attain and share assets equitably among members. When encountering faction minions or other characters, the assets generally available to the faction might be represented by those creatures having access to that asset at any time.  
Accessing faction assets takes an hour, and the asset will specify whether it costs social credit or not to use it. In either case, a character must be able to use Social C  
redit to use an asset, so their Social Credit for the day must be 1 or higher, and they must not be suffering any condition that prevents them from using social credit. Factions can only distribute their assets in areas in which they operate, so it can take additional time and resources to get to the drop off point. Other assets requirements, such as proficiency or a time restriction on use of the asset will be detailed in their description.

### Market Lists

Market lists, being extensive catalogues of equipment and prices, are an important asset that many factions use to lure membership. Whether they have access to unique items or uniquely low prices, faction-specific market lists can only be used by members. Everyone else uses a generic market list for the setting. 

### Minions

Minions are the low-level everyday people that make up the bulk of all people in the world. Information about a faction’s minions is provided along with other info about the faction in case you would like to interact with your faction. Most of the time you will be interacting with a minion.

## The Generic List of Assets to Bootstrap the Game  {#the-generic-list-of-assets-to-bootstrap-the-game}

**Altar**  
The faction controls an ancient source of natural power. You can spend one Social Credit to gain access to this altar.

**Spell Services**  
The faction includes individuals who are able to perform magic for the public.

Keep in mind when casting the spell that it is not your character that is casting it, but a hired faction member.

**Rights of Way**

# **Chapter 5 : The “Recon” Arena of Play, Dealing with Travel, Intelligence, Ambushes and the Like** {#chapter-5-:-the-“recon”-arena-of-play,-dealing-with-travel,-intelligence,-ambushes-and-the-like}

Spies, scouts hunters and strategists all specialize first in finding their quarry, and ensuring that when they do so they are at their most vulnerable. Recon skills are required to either of these things, and to defend against them being done to you and your allies. Your passive recon score represents the habits and perceptive abilities you have cultivated over a lifetime, from ensuring supplies are properly packed away from light fingers, to shoulder-checking your flanks as you pass through a doorway. Your active recon skills include tracking, strategizing, and sneaking, all ways to establish an encounter against an enemy precisely when they least want you to.

#### 

## 

## Recon Skills, Defined as Areas of Expertise and their Benefits {#recon-skills,-defined-as-areas-of-expertise-and-their-benefits}

Those proficient in recon skills have an area of expertise. This is either a specific environment type a specific creature type, or a specific region from official content.  
If your area of expertise is in a specific terrain such as forests or coast, you can apply your recon skill to any actions you take in that terrain such as avoiding detection, foraging, establishing encounters, etc. You can think of a character with a recon skill based on a terrain type as a ranger, sailor or other expert navigator of that particular terrain.  
If your area of expertise is a specific creature type, such as constructs or fey, you can apply your recon skill to any recon actions taken against that creature type in any context. If a party includes multiple creature types, establishing an encounter against any one of them is sure to establish an encounter against all of them, but they may split up to confound your pursuit. You can think of a character with an encounter skill based on a creature type as a hunter or assassin of that particular creature wherever it goes.  
If your area of expertise is a specific region, you can apply your recon skill to any strategic actions that take place in that region. You can think of a character with an encounter skill based on a region as a smuggler or detective, versed in every back alley detail of the physical and humanoid geography of the region, and how it all fits together.

### Proficiencies

Recon characters are often proficient with the use of **tools and equipment** specific to their trade. This could be, for example climbing equipment, traps, or even a single hunting weapon such as a bow or gun. They are also usually able to convert supply to a wide range of setting-appropriate utility items dealing directly with their skill. For example, a coast or ocean expert in a modern setting can expend one supply to come up with a life preserver.  
In addition to proficiency in long-distance strategic movement over a terrain type if they are experts in that terrain, a recon character might also be proficient in a different form of **movement** such as swimming or climbing, or in a terrain type even though they are not an expert in that terrain.  
Wherever relevant, the **operation of vehicles** falls to recon characters. This could include horseback riding, operating carts, barges, ferries, or other watercraft, or any other vehicle, since they rely largely on observation, and spatial awareness along with significant physical ability and dexterity.

### Geography and Movement

Recon characters are responsible for the strategic movement of their party, usually operating as the navigator and often the pilot or driver as well. Regional specialists are considered proficient in all terrain types in their region, while terrain specialists are only proficient in their terrain and creature specialists are not proficient in strategic movement unless it is in direct relation to their quarry.  
Strategic movement takes place from one locale to another and the challenges faced by the party in strategic movement are usually broken down into steps that pit the Recon characters’ skill against the natural world, resulting in loss of equipment, time, or even injuries if they are failed. When you decide to move between two locales, you may do so naturally, for example if there is a road and you have a vehicle. You may also do so transactionally, for example buying a train ticket, or your GM may set out a challenge or short adventure for your party to travel if the transit would be complicated or unsure for some reason.

### Surveillance

Recon specialists are adept at using their skills to find information through observation and insights about behaviors and actions. Surveillance is the recon component of the Intel phase of play. It relies on physical clues and observations instead of background knowledge, word-of-mouth, or magical means. You are proficient at surveilling anything or any creature you can sense in a region or terrain that you are specialized in. You are proficient at surveilling any creature of a type that you are a specialist in, as well as objects that directly relate to it such as “its vehicle” or “the bag it put down”. You can also surveil an item in relation to a creature type, restricting the intel gathered in such a way as “does this belong to a vampire”, or “has this recently been in contact with a divine?”  
Check out the page on the Intel Phase for more information.

### Initiating an Encounter

If a party would like to find themselves in the same locale as another at an opportune time, whether for combat, espionage, negotiations, or any other reason, they must first initiate an encounter. Initiating an encounter takes one hour. At the end of the hour, the encounter is established.  
You do not need a check if an encounter has already been established narratively, however you may use a check to earn initiative points, detailed in Chapter 6\. An initiative check is made just like any other check, you roll against your target’s passive score, and they may have an opportunity to counter with an active defense to evade you. If you succeed, you convert any damage to initiative points, which are interpreted as tactical positioning and actions readied ahead of the tactical, round-by round actions.

## Recon Equipment, In Particular Mounts, Vehicles and Packs {#recon-equipment,-in-particular-mounts,-vehicles-and-packs}

### Packs and Supply

Packs are sets of equipment meant to serve a specific purpose. They can be purchased in a market. All packs have two functions. First, they have a use described in the pack’s description, usually conferring a buff or small static bonus, or the ability to perform an action in exchange for supply. Secondly, all packs can be used to retrieve specific items that the player wants that would conceivably be in the pack by spending one supply. For example, if a character has a camping pack, it is conceivable that they have a knife in it. They can expend one supply to retrieve their knife for a specific use or encounter.  
Supply is often used as a pseudo-currency. It can be found or acquired using encounter strategies and faction assets, and it’s a good thing to keep in stock. If your supply runs out, it’s assumed your equipment is being run down, falling into disrepair and being generally neglected to the point that it stops being useful. Lamps are running out of oil, ropes are being cut into smaller and smaller pieces, etc. Supply is usually sold in groups of 10\. Up to 10 supply fits into a pack, or on its own 10 supply is considered a medium bundle.  
You can only use supply to pull things out of a pack that would be in the pack. For example if you have 10 supply and a perfume pack, and your partner has 10 supply and a mountaineering pack, you can pull 10 different perfumes, bottles, etc, from your pack but no ropes, and your partner can pull 10 lengths of rope from their pack but no perfumes. You can trade supply to one another to make better use of your packs. Don’t think too hard about it.  
If you really want to try to turn supply into something reasonable, but no one has the corresponding pack, you can try to make an encounter check to come up with the item in question. For example, if your entire party is loaded out with adventure and dungeoneering and mountaineering packs and you suddenly need a paper and pen, you can try an encounter check to see if anyone happens to have something that will work. You can also just procure anything like that from a market for the cost of one supply. It is assumed you trade a rope or flashlight or something for a pen and paper.

### Mounts and Vehicles

Characters may come into possession of mounts or vehicles that they are proficient with, usually through a quest or faction, though in some settings certain mounts like horses are common market commodities. Platforms are almost always too complex and economically impactful to be market commodities, requiring specialized logistics to operate, and are therefore considered features of the geography or faction assets.

## The List of Recon Strategies To Get Things Rolling {#the-list-of-recon-strategies-to-get-things-rolling}

**Ambush**  
If you successfully defend a recon attack, you can expend one energy to treat the result as a counter-attack.

**Camouflage**  
Expend one supply per target. When that target begins any encounter before their next long rest or change of clothes, they begin the encounter hidden.

**Cover**  
During any initiative phase you can deploy a 2m piece of cover adjacent to an ally for each initiative point you use.

**Decoy**  
You can spend an hour setting up a decoy, giving the decoy your passive encounter score. Until your next rest, opponents attempting encounters against you or your party will hit the decoy unless they get a breakthrough.

**Defensive Position**  
You provide cover to all adjacent targets designated by expending an initiative point each. If the targets move, they lose their cover and cannot rejoin the defensive position. If you move, the entire defensive position is lost.

**Delay**  
You can expend 1 energy to gain 3 initiative points when you lose a recon check.

**Drills**  
Choose one creature or terrain type each time you take this abilit bvb  y. You gain \+1 initiative point in all encounters against parties that include at least one of creature of this type.

**Egress**  
As a reaction to having an encounter initiated against you, you can exchange one energy and one initiative point to have one creature or object on your side removed from the encounter before it begins.

**Entrench**  
If an encounter is initiated against you when you are resting, you can add barricades to the map by spending initiative points.

**Forager**  
When you rest in terrain that you are proficient in, you need not eat rations.

**Helper**  
You add \+1 initiative point in any encounter you are involved with that you do not initiate.

**Herdsman**  
When you rest with animals such as horses, camels or mules in their natural terrain, they are fed without rations.

**Rally**  
If you use an initiative point in the initiative phase to move an ally closer to you or to move closer to an ally, you can double this movement. You and your allies are immune to afraid and panicked during initiative phases.

**Reactive Casting**  
You can expend 1 energy and 1 initiative point to prepare a spell with a casting time of one minute to be cast on your first turn in the ensuing encounter.

**Rush**  
If you win an encounter, you can spend one encounter point per target to ensure that the targets do not have their weapons or magic focuses drawn when the encounter starts.

**Stray**  
You can exchange initiative points to maneuver enemies during the initiative phase. You may only maneuver any creature once.

**Sunder**  
You can use initiative points to make attacks against equipment during the initiative phase.

**Survivalist**  
If you make any hour-long recon check in terrain with which you are proficient in a day, you can also resupply either one ration or one supply per day.

**Tactical Gear**  
You arrange your equipment such that you are always ready for an encounter. You always start encounters with your weapon drawn and unencumbered. If you would have been encumbered, you can choose to have dropped everything before combat began and mounted/dismounted your mount.

**War Cry**  
Use one energy and one encounter point to make a tremendous war cry using your encounter skill. All creatures of a lower level than you must make a save against fear or be afraid of your entire party.

## The Section Dealing with Consequences of Checks or How to Interpret Results {#the-section-dealing-with-consequences-of-checks-or-how-to-interpret-results}

The core mechanics of the game leave you with a result of a check. The result is either negative, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or above 4\. This means there are degrees of success or failure. Broadly speaking these degrees of success can be understood or interpreted as the consequences of an action, but depending on the overall intent of the action, the consequences are different. For example, you can throw a punch in Round Table with the intention of incurring a physical condition such as *dazzled,* or a social condition such as *afraid*, but you can also throw a punch with the intention of starting a brawl to distract someone, or break free from a grab, or any other reason. The different intended consequences details below can help you interpret results into meaningful mechanical effects in the game. The example challenges given for each type of consequence are not exhaustive or prescriptive, but are meant as inspiration to help understand and implement the core rules.

### Bestow Conditions (attack)

If the intended consequence of your action is to cause a target to suffer a condition, you are attacking. Attacks can be done using any arena of play, for example throwing a punch, turning someone’s eyes into jello, embarrassing someone at a fancy party, or setting a trap to ensnare a target.  
When your objective is to cause a target to have a condition, you interpret a negative result as a miss. A result of 0 or above means you hit. Regardless of the secondary damage calculation, some abilities or definitions that rely on a “hit” might be activated.  
![][image5]  
Once you have determined that you hit, you add your weapon damage and subtract the damage reduction of your target. If the result is 0 or negative, you hit but did no damage. If the result is 1-4, you cause a minor condition, if it is 5 or above, you cause a major condition.

![][image6]

#### Damage can be augmented or reduced in various ways, using abilities and equipment that refer to damage or damage reduction.

#### **Skirmish**

You and two party members realize that you can probably take down a pair of opponents who are acting belligerently. You quickly run through initiative to establish your exact positioning, then you take your turn, each maneuvering straight toward them, then taking an action to attack each one, trying to cause the *afraid*, *stunned* or *dazzled* conditions. You roll a 7 and a 12 on the attack. Realizing the 12 could cause a serious critical condition, you keep the 7\. You have no weapons and the opponent has no armour and a passive defense of 6\. You cause the *stunned* condition.

#### **Trap**

You spend one hour and one supply setting up a trap to try to *paralyze* a fox that has been stealing from your camp. You roll a 6 and a 9, expending energy to take the 9, adding \+2 proficiency. The fox actively defends with a 3 and 7, adding \+1 proficiency. The result of 3 is augmented by the damage of the trap, \+1, but still only results in a 4 total: the *immobilized* condition. The fox gets away, but not unscathed.

#### **Insults**

You are squared up against an indifferent faction, but want to bait one of them to attack you as a distraction. You spit an insult at them, rolling a 7 and 7 on a faction attack and adding \+3. They roll 5 and 9, without proficiency they are forced to expend Social Credit to try to avoid a critical condition. They are *angry*, but not *enraged*, and do not attack you.

### Gain Intelligence

If the intended consequence of your action is to learn something or get evidence, you are engaged in intelligence gathering, also known as an “intel phase”. Gaining intelligence can be done using any arena of play, for example interrogating someone, auguring your own future, asking around town about the subject, or staking it out.  
When you take an action to get information or evidence, your result represents either a miss, meaning you got nothing, 1-4 individual pieces of information or evidence, or a breakthrough of 5 or above.  
![][image7]  
Intelligence can also be used to **establish** information that has not yet been established in the setting. In this case, the table agrees to suggestions made about what sorts of information might be revealed about things that have previously not been established in the game, for example the existence of a certain type of creature or the existence of a locale that has not yet been explored.  
Many abilities and equipment reference **Intel Points**, which can be added at this stage in accordance with the description of the ability or item. For example, if a pack gives you \+1 intel point when investigating arcane matters, you can add that to this check whenever you are investigating spells, spell effect, magical items or creatures, etc.

#### **Photography**

You use an hour and one supply from your photography pack to try to get hard evidence of the corruption of some guards. You roll an 11 and 7, expending one energy to take the 11 and adding your \+2 bonus. Their passive defense of 6 means you get a result of 7; a *breakthrough*. Not only do you get the perfect shot, but you also establish that the bribe they are paid has been handed off by a specific person of interest.

#### **Legend**

You cast the Legend major arcanum, expending energy to learn a number of public facts about a target. You roll a 3 and 11, needing to expend extra energy to take the 11 and add your \+9 magic proficiency bonus. Your total of 6 is a *breakthrough*, revealing that the target is a shapeshifter.

#### **Investigation**

You ask around town about the strange happenings at a local bowling alley. You get a 2 and 5, expending 1 social credit and adding your proficiency of \+3 for a total of 8\. Unfortunately the difficulty of finding out information about the bowling alley is also 8, so you don’t learn anything that isn’t trivial or public knowledge.

#### **Surveillance**

You stake out an important crossroads. You expend one supply using a recon pack to buff your roll of 2 and 12, and add your proficiency of \+4. Against the difficulty of 9, your result is 7; a breakthrough. Your GM allows you to establish the arrival of a character of your choice, and to move to an initiative check to try to ambush them at the crossroads.

#### **Shopping**

You are looking for a silver weapon to fight a werewolf in a small village. It’s not out of the question, but it’s an odd thing to find. Your roll of 1 and 8 necessitates that you use 1 Social Credit to buff the roll and add your proficiency of \+7 for a total of 15\. It would be a breakthrough if you were looking for local tier village items like a silver cutlery set, but you’re looking for specialized magical weaponry, so the difficulty is 13\. You were hoping for a number of options, but you find only two; a box of antique silver crossbow bolt heads, and a single-use bag of silver powder that can be used on any weapon.

### Gain Initiative

If the intended consequence of your action is to set up a tactical situation to your advantage, you are engaged in initiative. Initiative can be gained through any arena of play, for example jumping suddenly to physical violence in an unexpected setting, teleporting into an enemy’s camp, sending an invitation that cannot be turned down, or hunting a creature down.  
You almost always attempt to gain initiative ahead of another discrete challenge or event like a skirmish. The result of this initiative check allows you to adjust the starting situation to your advantage by a number of maneuvers or actions corresponding to your result. These actions or maneuvers cannot impact opponents unless you have a special ability that allows for it, and each creature can only take a single maneuver and action as a result of an initiative challenge.  
![][image8]

* The defender in an initiative challenge first establishes their positioning and what their creatures are doing in a way that suits the context.   
* Next, the attacker establishes how they enter the scene.  
* Next, the defender uses whatever initiative they may have earned through abilities or the initiative check to alter their starting position or actions.  
* The attacker then makes use of their own initiative points in the same way. 

You are left with the situation immediately before whatever event you were preparing for. At the outset of that event, the *winner*, not the attacker goes first.  
A breakthrough result (5 or above) allows hidden objects and creatures to be revealed and may allow other abilities and circumstances to take effect, but otherwise gives only 5 initiative points no matter the actual result number.  
There can be a long, tense period between the initiative phase’s end and the beginning of the event, especially if the attacker loses and realizes that kicking off the event would put them at a major disadvantage. During such a standoff, actions and maneuvers can be taken as checks against kicking off the main event.

#### **Interplanar Ingress**

You conduct a specialized ritual at an altar to force your way into Abqaria. You roll an 8 and 9, adding your proficiency of \+8 for a total of 16\. You don’t know what you face on the other side, but the passive difficulty of 15 means they must be powerful, You can only take one action or maneuver, so you make a snap decision to use it to assess the faction relations of whoever you see when you arrive.

#### **Contrived Meeting**

You pen a carefully worded letter to invite a target to a party, obfuscating both your intentions and the etiquette of the event. You roll a 6 and 11, satisfied with the 6, you add your \+2 faction skill for a total of 8\. Your opponent has opted to counter-strike, and also rolls a 6 and 11, but uses one Social Credit and adds their \+3 for a total of 14\. The result is \-6. They have earned a breakthrough against you

#### **Hunt**

You are aware that a target creature, such as a deer, exists within the region, and are seeking to get within range to attack it. You roll a 9 and 4, expending 1 energy to take the 4 and adding your proficiency bonus of \+4 for a total of 8\. The deer actively defends, being aware that there are predators in the region, rolling a 5 and 3, taking the 5 and adding \+1 for a total result of 2 in your favour. When the GM sets out a clearing in a forest map, they place you on one side and the deer on the other. You use your result to move closer and hide.

### Social Change

If the intended consequence of your action is to change relations or acquire assets, you are engaged in the social sphere. Any arena could be used, for example engaging in a friendly sports competition, charming someone with magic, simply arguing with them, or disguising yourself as someone else.  
When you engage in a challenge to make a social change, the result reflects a success or failure to make a unilateral or multilateral change, or a number of concurrent success options. For example, if your result is 3, you might be presented with three possible successful outcomes to choose from.  
You do not need to make a check to take actions that are appropriate to your current relation with another creature, however you do need to either convince them to engage in actions of a higher relations status, or make a check or save to do something of a lower status without repercussions such as a permanent downgrading of that status.

#### **Sports**

You would like to gain access to the backrooms of a bowling alley, but the employee there is only hospitable toward you. He welcomes you into the public areas but won’t allow you into the forbidden zone. You suggest a quick arcade game boxing match to settle the score as leverage. If he wins, you leave, if you win, he lets you in to the back room. You roll a 3 and 4, keeping the 3 and adding your \+6 for 9 total. Your opponent rolls a 2 and 7\. As a minion with only a \+1, he is awestruck by the speed of your hands on the controls and admits defeat. Not only does he allow access into the back room, but he lets a secret slip about his manager hosting some sort of meetings there periodically.

#### **Acquisition**

Your party scurries into a boat you find on shore to quickly cross the river. Knowing that you don’t need any additional heat for stealing a fishing boat, you quickly scribble out a message to the owner as your companions paddle. You won’t be there to convince them, so you seal the note with 1GP as leverage and leave it to your passive faction skill of 9 to hopefully do the job. The farmer who owns the boat later discovers it has been moved across the river, an act of brazen indifference to his needs. He finds the note, a plea for forgiveness and an offer of restitution. Against his passive 6 as a minion, it is convincing. He lets the matter go.

#### **Incite**

As the train disembarks from the station, suddenly your travelling companions turn on you. They’re robbing you, and you have nowhere to go. You look to the other passengers on the train. Using the betrayal (acting out of line) as leverage, you plead for their help, for those that are hospitable among them to take a single benevolent action to intervene. You roll a 9 and 10, keeping the 9 and adding your \+4 for a total of 14\. Another party member distracts your opponents with sudden movements and the threat of violence; their reactions are expended and you only need to contend with their passive defense of 9\. A breakthrough\! The other passengers are outraged by the robbery and resolutely take your side. 6 of them are now benevolent toward your party for the next minute.

### Position Change

If the intended consequence of your action is that your position relative to a target, but irrespective of the general geography, should improve, you are engaged in positioning. Any arena can be used to change position relative to a target, for example wrestling them, banishing them to another plane of existence, tearing them down socially, or playing cat-and-mouse.  
When you make a check to change your position, 0 or below indicates that your position relative to your target does not change. 1-4 usually indicates that the position changes by one unit, as defined in the context of the specific positioning, and a breakthrough usually indicates that the positioning resolves entirely in your favour. Sometimes longer, more granular positioning challenges are desirable, such as races, in which case 1-4 indicates that number of interval units of change, whereas a breakthrough indicates a significant shift in dynamics, again detailed by the specifics of the challenge at hand.  
The participants of a position challenge should conceivably both be able to achieve their goals. A race to a balloon between a snail and a bird is not resolved by a race challenge as the snail cannot conceivably win by way of racing.

#### **Grappling**

When grappling, there are two positions held by participants that are conceivably able to grapple eachother. If they are close in size or strength, but there is a clear advantage, the GM may buff the larger or stronger participant on all rolls.  
 The Clinch is where either creature is holding the other or they are holding eachother. When in a clinch, either creature can only target the other, and any maneuver requires a challenge against the other creature. Control is where one creature is able to control the other’s entire body. While in control they can target any creature as usual, and they can maneuver at half their speed without a check. They can also freely leave the grapple from control, or make a check to throw their opponent out of it. The controlled creature can only try to escape as their action. Moving from a clinch to control requires an active check from both participants, but you can defend control with a passive check if you so choose.

As a result of previous challenges, a wolf has hit you, automatically achieving a clinch. Without proficiency, you roll an 8 and 8 to try to gain control whereas the wolf is proficient but rolls a 4 and 3\. They keep the 3, adding their proficiency of \+1, so the total is 4 in your favour. You gain control of the grapple, allowing you to choose to end it, move the wolf, or take a number of other actions on your next turn.

#### **Possession**

There are three positions in a possession. The first is proximal, which means that the possessor is physically located in such a place that they can begin the possession. Sometimes they are astral or ethereal, so their actual geographic location is less important than the fact that they are in position to attempt the possession. From proximity, the possessor can make a check to move to latency.  
Latent means that the possessor’s location is now the same as the target. The target is aware that it is in a latent possession, but is not necessarily aware of the possessor’s identity. Other creatures cannot target the possessor without some inherent ability to target ethereal, astral or possessing creatures, and even if they have those abilities, they must make a check when targeting the latent possessor or their action will impact the victim instead. The possessor gains an additional sense, being the victim’s primary sense. Otherwise both the possessor and victim can act normally. Most creatures capable of possession must be in a latent state in order to take a long rest. The possessor can make a check to move to a dominant position  
Dominant possession transforms the victim into a passive vessel. They lose all actions, maneuvers, minor actions and reactions, and the possessor can choose to use their body to perform those roles. Actions that do not specifically target the ethereal or astral possessing creature will always target the victim’s body instead. Possessors can usually expend their own energy when in a dominant state to move the vessel even if it is not ordinarily or presently capable of movement, such as levitating small possessed objects, or causing a body to continue moving after the victim has died.  
As a result of narrative events, a creature has decided to touch an idol, making them proximal to the divine within. The divine that is currently latent in the idol makes a check against the interloper, rolling 12 and 7, taking the 12 by expending energy, and adding their \+1 proficiency. The target senses the sudden jolt of energy and makes an active check to resist, attempting to jerk their hand away. They roll a 12 and 10, taking the 10 and adding their \+1, resulting in a 2 in favour of the divine. It has moved to a latent position in its new host, who is aware that something strange has happened, but not aware of what it could mean.

#### **Racing**

Racing may have any number of incremental positions, from two to a thousand, depending on your needs. If the participants are slightly faster or slower, but the race outcome is still questionable, the GM may determine that participants are buffed or debuffed overall to reflect their relative speed handicaps. The positions describe how far ahead and behind the participants are, not necessarily their precise location in geographical terms.  
When racing, you use your maneuver and sometimes action and other abilities to try to gain positioning against the predefined difficulty of the race track. There is usually a number of rounds to be completed that signal the end of the race, and the winner is the one in the most advanced position at that time, or else the finish line is a predefined number of position advancements overall. When participants maneuver, they add the result to their positioning to a maximum of 5, with additional actions or abilities sometimes adding positioning.  
Racer A is 3 spots behind B, who is one spot behind C. A rolls 4 and 12, expending energy to take the 12 and adding their \+2 proficiency. The base difficulty of the track is 8, so A moves up 5 spaces total. First, moving 3 to the same position as B, then B uses an ability and their reaction to try to block A. They roll 3 and 1, expending energy to take the 3 and adding their \+2. 5 is insufficient to overcome A’s passive racing skill of 7, so B’s defense is ineffective. A moves up to C’s position, then moves ahead one more position to become the leader.

#### **Social Standing**

A social standing challenge includes a favourable, neutral and unfavourable position, which any number of participants can occupy simultaneously. The challenge might continue for a specific number of rounds that is either known or unknown to the participants, such as until the known arrival of the King, or the unknown time that a character will die, triggering inheritance.  
While engaged in a social standing challenge, participants take turns either trying to elevate their own position or reducing that of others. The challenge may be to gain the favour of a specified other party, the participants themselves, the public, or any other individual or group of humanoids.  
You have located a valuable faction asset, but it is currently reserved for the use of a different faction member. You have until midnight, when the asset is distributed, to convince the faction to give it to you. You are currently neutral and the other member is favourable for this outcome, so you roll a faction check to attempt to ameliorate your position in the eyes of the custodian of the asset. You roll a 9 and 7, and add your faction proficiency bonus of \+6, taking the 7 for a total of 13\. The custodian’s passive faction skill is 11, so you have moved to a favourable position as well.

#### **Summoning**

A summoning challenge includes an inside, liminal and outside position with a summoner(or banisher) and a target. The target is trying to get to inside or outside, and the opponent is trying to get them to the opposite position.  
Outside means the target is not in the same plane as the summoner but still in a position to be perceived and targeted by them.  
Liminal means the target is passing between planes. It is considered ethereal in both planes and can only move or communicate in both simultaneously if it can naturally move and communicate while ethereal, but for the purposes of breathing and other environmental considerations it is considered to be in its home plane.  
Inside means the target is on the same plane as the summoner.  
Each opponent can use whatever resources are at their disposal on their turn to attempt to move the target between these positions. Once the target is in the desired position, they make another check against the opponent to end the summoning challenge, or sometimes it will end automatically at the expiration of a planar convergence or spell duration time.  
You have stepped into a magic circle in an ancient ruin, allowing a Jinn in Abqaria to attempt to summon you as you are now considered “Outside” its plane. It rolls an 8 and 2, expending 1e to take the higher score and adding its proficiency bonus of \+11. You roll a 6 and 7, even if you reached for the higher one your proficiency bonus of \+6 is not nearly high enough. The Jinn has achieved a *breakthrough* and you are instantly transported through liminal space to *inside* Abqaria. You find yourself in a realm of choking heat and blinding light, and for the moment within a corresponding magic circle in this new plane. You might try to fight your way back to liminal space, or you might reserve your energy to escape another way.

### Location Change

If the intended consequence of your action is to move physically or metaphysically from one location to another, you are engaged in travel. Any arena might be used to travel, for example climbing a fence, hovering across a body of water, hitchhiking, or leading a caravan.  
To start with travel, it is often necessary to perform an inventory call, or at least to conceptualize how all of the creatures and equipment are intended to get to the destination. Next, an itinerary may be drawn up that indicates how many obstacles there are before reaching the destination, and what happens if the destination is not reached in time or at all.  
A negative result in a travel check will either lead to a loss of equipment (usually expressed as supply), or a loss of time, if time is critical to the journey for any reason, and it may or may not indicate that the obstacle is not crossed at all. For example, if the goal is to jump a fence to catch a train and you fail, it could mean that you lose supply as something falls out of your bag as you successfully jump the fence, or that you fail to jump the fence quickly enough to catch the train, even though you do get over the fence. The question is whether or not failure to reach the destination is logical or meaningful in the narrative.  
A result of 1-4 might indicate that you succeed at 1-4 iterations of the check, for example 1-4 members of your party make it to the train on time.

#### **Tactical Obstacles**

You attempt to scale a fence that is only slightly taller than you. You roll a 1 and 2, expending 1 energy to take the 2 and adding your proficiency of \+4 for a total of 6\. The base difficulty of the locale is 6, so you make it over the fence.

#### **Strategic Obstacles**

A flood has washed out a road. Crossing at the washed out point is impossible, you will have to backtrack and find another way across. You roll 10 and 10, adding your proficiency of 7 and compare it to the region’s base difficulty of 11, for a result of 6; a breakthrough. You do not spend any extra time or resources, you find a convenient ford nearby and carry on your journey.

### 

# Chapter 7 : Advanced Rules and Appendices {#chapter-7-:-advanced-rules-and-appendices}

With the basics out of the way, feel free to play around to get the hang of them. Explain an action to your more experience players, they’ll tell you the difficulty to beat, then roll an outcome and see if it works. Now moving on to the next stage, we can examine rules about specific situations.

## Health and Conditions {#health-and-conditions}

There are no health points of any kind in Round Table. Creatures in Round Table are subject to conditions that alter how they are able to act, which have a minor and critical form, and can be temporary, ordinary, or permanent. Damage is calculated only to select either a minor or critical condition as appropriate, with 1-4 damage inflicting a minor condition and 5+ inflicting a critical condition.  
The only impacts of damage or harm should be specific conditions, which give your table flexibility to impose debuffs on certain checks, etc. No wounds system or generalized debuffs should be used.  
Minor conditions reduce the number of actions you can take, or your effectiveness at those actions, whereas Critical Conditions greatly reduce your actions, usually to only a select few.  
When a creature takes 1-4 damage, they will be subject to a minor condition related to the source of the damage. Sometimes the source will detail conditions, sometimes the conditions will follow logically from the fiction. For example, it can be assumed that a bear trap should cause the immobilized condition.  
If a creature takes 5 or more damage, the critical form of the condition in question is imposed rather than the minor form. In the example of the bear trap, failing a save so drastically causes the victim to faint due to shock and become unconscious. You can also stuffer a critical condition if you would receive a minor condition, but are already subject to the identical minor condition, for example, if you would be dazzled but are already dazzled, you would be blinded instead.

Critical conditions generally remove creatures from play. If the creatures are enemy minions, you can generally discard them without worrying too much about the details of their conditions. The GM or other players might track critical conditions in key opponents or allies if needed.  
If a player’s character receives a Critical Condition, on the other hand, the Critical Condition must be resolved when the party has a chance to rest and compose themselves. A Critical Condition resolves itself after a long rest, turning to its minor form, unless there is a narrative reason that it might resolve into a permanent injury or death.

A **Permanent Injury** imposes a minor or critical condition on a creature that cannot be resolved until the party completes some other task, essentially standing in the way of their progress until they complete a side-bar. In the example of the bear trap, it could lead to an amputation, imposing the immobilized condition on the victim until the party finds some way to restore them. Generally speaking, it’s up to the players, along with the GM, to agree on a permanent injury as well as its solution. If the players want to play a very gritty game, they may impose permanent injuries as the norm.

**Death** occurs when a character is pursuing their Fate, and receives a critical condition as part of that pursuit. The choice to die is ultimately up to the player as a way to resolve their critical injury.

**Temporary Injuries** are removed automatically at the end of a tactical encounter or minute, or if the condition of the injury is removed, for example a bear trap may only immobilize an opponent as long as it is attached to them and can simply be removed.

#### **Physical Conditions**

| Wounded Your movement is reduced to half and you can only take one action or bonus action or reaction per round in addition to your maneuver. | Incapacitated You can only take bonus actions. |
| :---- | :---- |

| Stunned All maneuvers are considered reckless and you do not have a reaction. | Unconscious. You cannot use your natural senses or move your body but are immune to further social conditions. |
| Inebriated You are debuffed on faction checks and saves. | Intoxicated You lose all proficiencies and some natural abilities including walking and basic vision. |
| Ailing You cannot use energy to buff checks and saves | Afflicted You cannot use energy at all |

#### **Social Conditions**

| :---- | :---- |
| Afraid You cannot move toward or target the subject of your fear | Panicked You must use your action and maneuver to move, recklessly if necessary, away from the subject of your fear. |
| Charmed You are benevolent toward the subject of your charm. | Beguiled You are Dedicated toward the subject of this condition. Faction and social interactions cannot change this status. |
| Angry You are debuffed on recon checks and saves. | Enraged Your social standing with all individuals becomes belligerent, and you are always considered to be acting belligerently. |
| Anxious You treat all faction checks as saves. | Paranoid You cannot access your faction or personal assets or use Social Credit. |

#### **Magic Conditions**

| Maligned All Magic and Faction checks are treated as saves. | Cursed You are unable to heal any other conditions until this condition is resolved. All your checks are treated as saves. |
| :---- | :---- |
| Malcomposed You lose proficiency in your natural abilities as parts of your body decompose into strange forms. | Transmogrified You lose your natural abilities (possibly gaining others with which you do not have proficiency) as your limbs and organs are replaced with… others. |

#### **Exhaustion**

When you are forced to expend energy beyond your lower limit of 0, the remainder is taken as damage, imposing a related condition.. For example, if you are given a sleeping potion that consumes 10 energy, and you only had 2 left, you would suffer 8 damage from the potion, giving you a critical injury, most likely *unconscious*..

#### **Suffocation and Drowning**

Usually, these effects are the result of a tactical challenge such as escaping a sinking ship or swimming across a dangerous river or identifying noxious air. Failure leads to your character drowning or suffocating, the outcome being that they are incapacitated.

#### **Possession**

If a creature is possessed, conditions should be specified to affect the body, the host, or the possessor. All three are considered to occupy the same space, and only a creature with a primary sense capable of sorting them out can choose which to hit with a spell or other attack, otherwise they can only target the element that is most obvious to their primary sense, for example the body for creatures relying on sight. The host and the possessor can simultaneously try to control the body, but more often one overcomes the other and subjects them to a condition that renders them incapable of controlling the body such as incapacitated. If the body is rendered incapable of moving or acting, so too are both the host and possessor.

### Resting And Healing

#### **Healing**

Healing is expressed as the removal of conditions. The simplest form is when temporary conditions end because the events that concern the temporary condition end. For example, if a creature is afflicted with *afraid* temporarily, and the object of their fear is destroyed, they are no longer *afraid.* Temporary conditions also end automatically after the tactical event or one minute.  
Various abilities, spells and equipment might present other ways to resolve conditions instantly or in short order, or concurrently with natural healing, allowing for multiple conditions to be removed at once. Otherwise, natural healing is detailed in the following section on resting.

**Resting**  
A short rest takes one hour and requires the creature resting to be able to move its body if it is able and to eat. Any effects that require a short rest come into effect once the hour is over, and most creatures can remove one minor condition over the course of their short rest. They also bring their current energy level up to half of their maximum if it had fallen below that.  
A long rest requires 8 hours and for the creature to both eat and sleep, as well as sufficient water for cleaning and drinking. At the end of the long rest, energy and social credit are restored up to the maximum and a single minor condition can be removed or a critical condition can be reduced to its minor form.

## Death, Fate and Levelling Up {#death,-fate-and-levelling-up}

In order to level up, your character must challenge their fate successfully. Challenging your fate is how your ordinary character can rise above, so it represents both an opportunity and an obstacle. For example, if you are fated to die in a snowstorm, you are also fated to level up by surviving a snowstorm. Once all the characters in your party are designed, you will work together to design your fates. Not every character or player needs to be challenging their fate at all times. In fact, it should be a relatively uncommon occurrence.

### The Fate Challenge

At some point in your adventure, you and your GM should detail the particulars of your next fate challenge, for example clarifying with them that you would like a particular event such as defeating a particular opponent to be your characters fate challenge. The GM will design a series of challenges that will statistically lead to your party failing the fate challenge by consuming your party’s energy and presenting difficulty ratings with a less than 50% chance of success. Without clever strategizing and planning, your character is likely to fail the fate challenge, so it’s up to you to figure out how to succeed.

### Levelling up

If you do manage to succeed at levelling up, you earn two levelling points. You can always use them to add 1 to your max Energy or Social Credit, or to learn a new ability in one of your two arenas of play. There are many other uses for levelling points, but your character must generally come across a specific opportunity to spend them (such as uncovering a unique Major Arcana), and then level up to take advantage of that opportunity.

## Economics {#economics}

### GP

While it is assumed that regions, factions, and even locales might have a particular form of currency, these different currencies are largely used in a practical sense to guide and restrict markets. You can usually only pay fines in the local currency, for example. Thus as a feature of market restriction rather than of wealth tabulation, currencies are integrated into the Round Table system of market tables and faction assets. To quickly and easily summarize the amount of wealth you can access, GP is used, which theoretically amounts to a day’s labour. In different cultures, different values of your daily wages may be accessible in different ways and different times, from grams of salt to digital wallets containing only debt, people are weird about how they imagine money, but we just use GP to roughly estimate the amount of stuff you can access at any given time. Just like a fancy L stands for pounds sterling, which is not pounds of silver but a complex digital fiat currency, GP stands for a days’ labour value.

The GP sign

### Treasure

Things that are not comparable to GP; unique quest items, are referred to as treasure. They cannot be bought, or they can only be bought with an amount of money that indicates that the exchange of actual cash is irrelevant to both parties. Nuclear weapons and Major Arcanum are examples of things over which money sometimes trades hands, but also things where the exchange of money is not really the key aspect of acquiring the treasure. If you would like to acquire treasure, come up with an adventure to do so.

### Inventory

Your inventory consists of the things that are being carried or stored by your party on your persons, minions, mounts, containers, and vehicles.

#### Inventory Slots

It is assumed your character has a number of “inventory slots”. For a standard human, you can think of your back, your body and each arm as a “slot”.  
Your back is a medium slot, whereas your body and each arm are small slots. You also carry insignificant items such as individual coins, rings, ammunition, the clothes you are wearing, etc. on your body. Clearly, if you are meant to be carrying inventory in your hands you cannot use them to do other tasks unless you put the items down. Similarly, your GM may prevent you from moving in certain ways such as squeezing if you have a backpack on or jumping if you are fully loaded out.  
There is not a specific number value of mass that restricts how your character is loaded out. Some people can carry a lot, some people can’t. The more serious restriction among people is not usually how much they can carry, but how much they are willing to carry, so it’s important to have a good vision in your mind of your character’s physical abilities and also their personality.  
A simple guide to follow is design intent. If your character would pick something up with one hand, it’s considered small. Items specifically made to be lifted in one arm are therefore considered small. Likewise, if you would use two arms to pick it up, or it is designed to be picked up by two handles or put on your back (for example, it has two arm straps like a backpack), it’s medium. Similarly, collections of items can be categorized this way as well. A soup can is small. A 12-pack is small. Some people would consider a 24-pack of cans to be small, some would lift it with both arms and consider it medium. Large items are those designed to be moved by two people or a pack animal. A human is probably capable of moving a large item without too much difficulty in the tactical environment, but you can’t travel while holding it in your hands.

#### Inventory Call

At the beginning of an adventure or long distance travel, sometimes at the beginning of an encounter, especially one involving theft or ambush, your GM may make an inventory call. When this happens, you simply have to tabulate how your character is loaded out. Go through their inventory and break things up into groups, figure out how your character is meant to be carrying them.  
You don’t have to track your inventory in this level of detail all the time. If the GM makes an inventory call and you realize your character’s inventory is unrealistic and they should have been overburdened for the past few hours of play, you can just move on, you don’t have to rectify past play. It’s at the inventory call that your character has finally been overcome with their burden and can’t carry on in this way any more or realizes they have forgotten something. You can also make minor adjustments in consultation with your table, for example exchanging some of your GP for a pack animal or cart when you realize you’re overburdened at the inventory call. It’s best to do an inventory call in a situation in which these exchanges make sense, for example while the party is passing through a market village. If nothing else, you can have your character try to fashion some sort of improvised sledge to try to drag a large inventory slot along with them.  
On the other hand, if you love logistics and hex-crawl style play, you can inventory call yourself all the time, and constantly know exactly how your character is carrying everything. You can also take over this role for the rest of the party if they agree to that, and tabulate how everyone is carrying everything. This role is meant to be a relief, not a burden. Don’t call out other players for their inventory, just suggest how to rectify it.

### Encumbrance and Burdens

You are capable of carrying more than you should. If you have maxed out every inventory slot on yourself or any other creature or cart, your loadout is burdensome. This imposes a debuff on all rolls while a creature is so encumbered. You are only encumbered as long as you carry the items, so if you could conceivably just put the items down while you do the task you are not encumbered. You should not carry so much inventory that all your slots are full, or carry more than half your weight.  
If it is unclear whether or not a given creature is capable of lifting or moving an object, the GM will have them make a graduating roll against the burden. The graduating roll indicates how long you can lift or carry the object for, starting with a roll to lift it and put it back down, then graduating to one round, one minute, and so on. A good rule of thumb is that this roll is required for any creature to lift more than its own weight, but certain strange creatures such as ants and jellies are more or less capable of carrying their own weight.

## Geography {#geography}

### Regions

Regions are distinct geographical areas characterized by shared human and physical geography. They serve as the foundation for world-building in Round Table, providing the context for adventures, encounters, and character interactions. Each region possesses unique characteristics that influence gameplay.  
A region’s **Name** reflects its defining cultural and physical characteristics.  
The **Terrain Type**, sometimes consisting of a pair of terrain types, defines the default terrain type that will be encountered whenever a creature travels in the region. It strongly influences the terrain type of locales, however locales are frequently little areas of a different terrain type within a region, which is what makes them notable.  
The **Base Difficulty** represents the overall difficulty level of navigating the region's terrain and social landscape. This value is used as a baseline for determining the difficulty of various checks and challenges within the region, and either represents how inhospitable and remote it is, or how coveted it is by factions.  
Regions contain any number of **Locales**, which are smaller tactical units that may represent an ordinary, stereotypical place in the Region, a unique spot, or a faction’s typical built environment that just so happens to be in the region. Each locale in a region is rarely defined, players are usually free to establish the existence of locales in a region as needed.  
**Recon Skills** providing specialization in a region have unique quirks and abilities that are defined in the region’s brief. They do not restrict those recon characters from operating outside the region, and often give them unique skills that are broadly applicable to other situations.  
Regions are deeply connected to a setting, with their own history and lore that covers all arenas of play, the overall world setting, different creature types, and many other considerations. Even when they are drawn directly from the infinitely diverse and awe-inspiring regions of the real world, they offer a unique in-game experience. Rather than generalized biomes like the ocean, or a forest, regions should emerge from a concept of truly unique places. As an example, when imagining and establishing a vast desert, do not stop with “the big desert” as a region. Instead, you can imagine several regions such as “the Lake of Dunes”, then “the Qattara Depression” then “Siwa Oaisis,” then “Red Dune Sea”, then “The Black Rocks,” then “the Great Wadi of Air”. These diverse regions each have their challenges and local lore, even though together they represent an 800km journey through what feels like an endless desert, and in fact they are all desert terrain type regions.

### Locales

Locales are specific locations within a Region that serve as settings for individual scenes and encounters. They represent the granular level of the game world, where players interact directly with the environment, NPCs, and challenges.  
Locales usually, but don’t always inherit the region’s **base difficulty**. If they have another difficulty rating, you should establish why that is. For example, a stronghold’s factions systematically build and guard it to increase its difficulty rating on purpose, whereas a village might represent an easier place to live in an otherwise rugged region.  
Locales are restricted in area, and can be butted up against eachother or even overlap. For example, an arena represents a complete play space, so could be one locale, while a small market street might represent another, even though the entrance to the arena is on that market street. The question is whether or not tactical actions can be shared through the space. The arena’s entry and exits are monitored, so passing between the arena and the market street takes some intention. This is why even if a spell effect, weapon, or anything else could theoretically reach into a neighboring locale, effects need to be tagged as strategic in nature to cross a locale’s boundaries. This applies to movement, communication, spell and equipment effects, faction operations etc.  
When establishing locales, avoid simply dictating that the things you need are in the locale. Be sure to establish why that locale should exist in the region, its impact on factions and creatures, its history, etc. Establishing these things can help other players by inspiring them to jump off your ideas, or reminding them of their own needs that might also be found in the locale, or help your table create engaging settings and conflicts that fit into your world.

### Travel

When travelling, the first thing you should do is an inventory call, so you can ensure that you can carry everything you need. You next define your destination and how you can get there. Creatures, mounts and vehicles have strategic movement speeds, whereas platforms typically operate with an itinerary. You establish how long the travel will take, and how many resources must be used to complete it, adding in rests if you want. Usually, you will break travel down into consistent units, so if you are meant to walk, then drive, then sail, you will be considered to be travelling three separate times. Sometimes you are interrupted in the middle of your travel and have to engage in a new mode, so you must start your travel considerations over.  
Once you have figured out what it will take to complete the travel, you can either consider it transactional: pass the time and resources necessary and be done with it, or your GM may design an adventure around it.

### Mounts, Vehicles and Platforms

Mounts are subject to the movements of their riders. Whether they are creatures or not, they are small enough that the movement and positioning of their riders is important to their own movement. For this reason, the rider and mount must both maneuver to the same goal, ie take the same maneuver, in order for them to both achieve that goal. Both rider and mount are subject to any saves or checks to clear terrain or take risky maneuvers, and it is possible for one or the other or both or neither to fail, and the result of that failure is visited upon whichever one of them failed.  
Vehicles, whether creatures or not, can withstand their occupants moving independently of them, however have limited space for those occupants to move, usually in the form of seats or cargo spaces. Vehicles might include a riding elephant, automobile, carriage, or raft. Movement on, over, or inside a vehicle is always squeezing and often risky, and there are a few specified positions that creatures can occupy.  
Platforms are very large objects or creatures that represent unique terrain that is able to move relative to the geography. Tactical events like skirmishes often take place on platforms, with the platforms’ interactions with the terrain and surrounding locale more often interpreted as a separate event. Creatures may or may not be proficient in types of movement that are characteristic of certain platforms, such as the jostling, shifting terrain of air and sea vessels, or the particular squeezing points of trains and aircraft.

### Platform Combat

Platform challenges are challenges that take place between vehicles, platforms, and sometimes terrain or structures. For example, racing cars, using a helicopter to rappel into a cavern, or taking boarding actions from one boat to another would be considered Platform challenges.  
Vehicles and platforms have statistics just like creatures. In fact, some vehicles and platforms are creatures. Both motorcycles and horses are mounts, both elephants and cars are vehicles, both huge dragons and helicopters are platforms. Platforms and vehicles have components like creatures have limbs, so you can target them to impose specific conditions such as immobilized, or to knock out a specific capacity such as a mounted weapon, however platforms can generally not be targeted by light weapons like bows and guns, they must be targeted by heavy weaponry, like-platform mounted machine guns or rockets.  
Boarding from one platform to another, or otherwise maneuvering off your platform or onto another is generally treated as a regular maneuver. If you are removed from platforms, structures, vehicles, and have no way to impact the platform challenge (you have no heavy weapons and can’t reasonably reach a platform), you are effectively incapacitated from the challenge.  
Maneuvering on platforms can usually be achieved by the move around maneuver, but such movement can be hampered by the very restrictive structure of the platform and the presence of many opponents in a tiny area. In effect, you can usually consider any change of position while on a platform, especially a hostile one, to be considered both risky movement and squeezing.

## The Section Detailing All Creature Types {#the-section-detailing-all-creature-types}

### Terrestrials

Terrestrials are mundane creatures that ultimately extract their energy from sunlight. They do not have innate magical powers as a creature category, though some individuals can exhibit the ability to control magic. For example, horses are Terrestrials as they eat photosynthesizing plants and are not magical, though it is possible to find one that could exhibit magical characteristics as an individual. Terrestrials are usually extremely abundant low level creatures.

**Natural Abilities**  
Round Table was created by terrestrials, and so takes many of their common attributes for granted such as seeing light and using chemical energy to effect physical movement.

**Sub-Types**  
Beasts are the largest subtype of terrestrials and include mammals, reptiles, amphibians and birds. Beasts include extinct animals such as dinosaurs.  
**Plants** are terrestrial growths. They usually don’t move and use photosynthesis to grow. Some plants can move or be magically altered to become mobile or carnivorous, but are still considered plants and therefore terrestrials. Plants can be poisonous, or in rare cases venomous. Plants are unique in that they can define a terrain type such as forests or grassland, and can also constitute rough terrain, cover and other features.  
**Fish** are another somewhat unusual subtype of terrestrials because they breathe water instead of air and swim without the ability to move on land. Terrestrial fish are the fresh or salt water varieties that live within the illuminated surface area of bodies of water.  
Humanoid terrestrials are the most common humanoid sub-type and include **Humans**.

### Constructs

Constructs are creatures that are comprised of mechanical and arcane materials and energy with individual components that do not lend life to the whole. A pile of bones or body parts is understood as “dead,” and those parts are not useful for any purpose but their former use as parts of a creature. Assembling them does not make them function, nor does it make the assembly “alive.” Somehow, the assembly of certain non-living materials and energies in certain ways does create utility or even something some might argue is “life.” These assemblies are Constructs, and their nature, alive or not, is the source of controversy and confusion for many. Constructs need not be humanoid thinking androids, they can be simple arcane or even mundane machines. The boundary and definition of construct is a key theme in any game including significant use of constructs. Don’t shy away from it. Let your party wrestle with it and decide whether a trap or a wagon is “construct” enough to be considered a creature. At what point does a construct stop being a construct? Is the severed arm of a construct a second construct? The finger? A single length of its pipe? These are questions for you to answer in your setting.

**Natural Abilities**  
Constructs are usually fundamentally different from other creatures. By default, constructs do not need to eat or breathe. They do need energy, which they may acquire from rest or from some other source such as a battery or spell components, so you should define how constructs in your setting regain expended energy. Similarly, constructs very rarely heal themselves, and instead must be repaired. Some can repair themselves, others rely on outside sources for repairs.

**Sub-types**  
**Clockworks** are mechanical constructs that are usually mundane in nature, though sometimes powered arcanely. They are usually powered by a crank and use a series of gears to deliver that power to achieve their extremely limited number of possible tasks.  
**Remnants** are constructs made of the flesh and bones left behind after death. It is important to remember that they are not undead. The undead are disembodied spirits. Their bodies, if they are made to wander after death, are constructs.  
Humanoid constructs are usually called **Androids**. They are extremely complex and may even have the capacity to be possessed by human minds, however the thing that makes them humanoids is that even without hosting another humanoid, they are capable of complex thought and socializing. A human shaped construct is not necessarily humanoid.

### Cthonites

Cthonites are underground, underwater and deep space creatures, those with strange bodies living in alien ecosystems of the Deep. Cthonites can be identified by the fact that they have many limbs and eyes compared to similar terrestrials, bioluminesce, and that there are no herbivores among them. There are plenty of omnivores, but there are not enough plants in the Deep to sustain a creature through all its life cycles, so even relatively harmless creatures such as caterpillars might have a dark side. They are predatory creatures of darkness that live primarily in the Deep, but can be found infesting many dark places in the surface realms.

**Natural Abilities**  
In addition to climbing and squeezing as natural movement, Cthonites can perceive their world in complete darkness, whether they do this through touch, bioluminescence, or some other sense is up to you. You can also choose to allow them to bioluminesce to communicate or to help see or be recognized in total darkness. The bioluminescence is rarely bright enough to be seen even in dim light, or to shed dim light on an area.

**Sub-types**  
**Mushrooms, lichens, mold** and other fungi are cthonite growths. They rarely move, though they are often poisonous, and they are just as often useful spell components.  
**Insects and spiders** are tiny cthonite creatures with exoskeletons and many legs. They are often venemous, and the varieties originating in the Deep can grow to be several dozens of kilograms. They are extremely strong for their size and make formidable opponents, especially when they are parts of colonies that can number in the tens of thousands of members.  
**Deep Fish** are aquatic cthonites that include cephalopods. They usually have very strange body shapes, many limbs, bioluminescence and sometimes also venom. In rare cases such as octopuses, they can squeeze and climb just like their terrestrial cousins.  
**Humanoid Cthonites** may include any sort of subterranean creature that has gained intelligence and society, including ant-people or underground elves.

### Divines

Divines are creatures who originate in a world outside of our own, often in many worlds outside of our own. This force imposes itself, usually upon humanoids, in a cosmic competition with the primordial spirits, often for the undead souls of humanoids. The exact nature of this conflict, how it is played out, and the ultimate source and goal will be different for every setting, but the divines represent a significant force in the universe that can be used to achieve great good. Whether or not this is borne out in practice is up to you, as there is absolutely no expectation that the divines are aligned with goodness, though the gods often use cults to define goodness around their own moralities.

**Natural Abilities**  
Divines have the natural ability to perform magic as their primary skill. Their bodies may also be impervious to mortal weapons. They do not need to eat or breathe, but they do need to spend a significant amount of time resting to recover lost energy, and they must do so on an altar. Divines can sometimes procreate through the creation of children, and sometimes have the power to grant apotheosis; to transform another creature type into a divine.

**Sub-types**  
**Demi-gods** are monstrosities that include divines. They can be any type of divine attached to any other creature, for example a fish that has eaten and become fused with an idol, or a regular everyday human whose mother is human and whose father is a god, or whose great-great-great grandmother is a god who gave birth to her ancestor, three magic fish and a spear, all of which are demi-gods. Demi-gods, like most monstrosities, exhibit traits of both sides of their nature but usually more detrimentally than beneficially. Demi-gods often search for their non-divine side to be granted apotheosis so they can become fully divine.  
**Demons** and their humanoid versions, devils, could play an important role in your game. Their exact nature in relation to the rest of the divines is up to you, but they are characterized as those in direct and necessary opposition to the divines, creating a clearly defined “good” and “evil.” Some might say they were created by the divines just to create such a distinction.  
**Idols** are divines that have taken the form of an inanimate object. They can communicate telepathically and can cast spells without moving or making a sound. They can sometimes assume an ethereal form to interact with the world around them, though they frequently enchant others to do their bidding instead. Idols, like magic objects, cannot be destroyed by mundane means.  
Humanoid divines, usually called **Gods**, socialize somewhat with eachother, but seem to socialize excessively with weaker humanoids, who they are much more likely to collect into a cultish faction beneath them. Pantheons of associated divines usually collect themselves exclusively to protect themselves from being killed by eachother or other powerful creatures so they can be left to toy with the lesser folk in relative peace.

### Draconids

Draconids are arcanavores. They are creatures that acquire their energy from magic. Collecting massive heaps of magic items, spell components, focuses, even altars to sleep on only forms part of their quest for power. They are also unusually capable of destroying magic items using dragonfire, an explosive arcane reaction that tears magic from its tethers in the physical world. Dragonfire is not necessarily a breath weapon, many draconids keep it in their bellies to melt magic items they eat. Once rendered into smoke or dust in this way, the magic from a destroyed magic item can be consumed by draconids like food. Their scaly skin protects them from physical damage, and the magic residues in it protect them from magic as well. Draconids sometimes also exhibit feathers, and often have wings, whether or not they use them to fly, and can have anywhere from zero to dozens of legs.

**Natural Abilities**  
Draconids exist more in the arcane world than their closely related kin; the terrestrials and cthonites. They are arcanavores, meaning they eat spell components rather than food and are the only creatures that can naturally destroy magic items, by using their dragon fire to consume them. They usually hibernate, which is to say they take long rests that can last days or even decades. Draconid skin usually confers damage reduction to physical or magical attacks or both and draconids usually sense magic directly as their primary sense.

**Sub-types**  
**Dragoneaters** are an audacious, subcategory of draconids that actually hunt, kill and eat other draconids. Usually preying on the young or those hibernating, dragoneaters include behirs and wyverns, both lacking breath weapons or strong magic, but both packing dragoneater poison, a powerful venom that can paralyze and kill draconids of any size. After gorging themselves, dragoneaters only need to hibernate for a matter of days before they can be on the hunt again, and they can go over a year between meals. They are also shameless scavengers, and will descend upon a dragon carcass in terrifying squabbling flocks.  
**Drakes** are classical European style dragons with two or four legs, scales, no feathers, and wings. They breathe fire and/or dragonfire that looks like fire. They usually live in cycles that include long hibernation periods before they emerge to devastate the landscape until they have destroyed the entire ecosytem and consumed all the magic, then they hibernate some more. This apocalyptic cycle is revered by humanoids who live in drake-infested lands, but it also serves to protect the drakes, as they end up killing all the young dragoneaters and the humanoids in the area so they are not ambushed when they go back to sleep. Drakes can usually only benefit from a long rest that lasts longer than 100 years.  
**Wyrms** are draconids with any number of legs, with or without wings, but who have very long, serpentine bodies. Wyrms do not go through the same apocalyptic cycles as drakes, but can become equally powerful over their extremely long lifetimes. They hibernate, and usually focus on creating a hoard of magic items and altars powerful enough to give them restful sleep instead of consuming all the magic they can find in a reign of terror. As they hiberate, they periodically exhale dragonfire and slowly burn their entire hoard to magic smoke, which they then breathe over the course of their hibernation. Magic smoke leaking out of a mountain is a telltale symptom of a great wyrm living nearby.  
Humanoid draconids are called **Dragons**. They may be drakes or wyrms with the ability to talk and socialize, or they may even be capable of shapeshifting into human-like forms. They still consume magic items, but may either install themselves at the top of cults to themselves to force other humanoids to bring them what they need, or socialize with other dragons to form powerful alliances or cultures among themselves.

### Elementals

Elementals are creatures that are composed primarily of a single element and who are animated by arcane energies. They are not created by humanoids, but are naturally occurring and self-proliferating, and their bodies are made of their element, not of inert pieces attached together. Elementals usually come from elemental planes, and can be composed of pure individual elements such as titanium, mixed or abstract elements such as stone, or even energies such as light or abstract concepts like love.

**Natural Abilities**  
Elementals naturally have either an ethereal or physical form. Sometimes they can shapeshift only into a familiar physical or ethereal form that they also use frequently. Usually both of these forms are elements. For example, an ice mephit may be able to shapeshift into water vapor, but its natural form is ice. Elementals are not naturally immune or resistant to their element or energy type. Humans are largely made of bones, but if you shove a bone into a human, they usually die. Similarly, an elemental made of fire would die if you shoved a bunch of fire into it. Elementals are naturally proficient with magic though, so they often have transmutative and other magical abilities that make it hard to kill them with their chosen element.

**Sub-types**  
There are many **elemental growths**. In places far from the terrestrial realm, elemental growths such as gemstone crystals and ore veins make up the primary food source for many creatures and sometimes constitute considerable dangers due to poison or self-replication on or inside the bodies of nearby hosts.  
**Mephits** are small elemental creatures that can easily be enchanted or otherwise coerced to work for humanoids. Much like pets, they are intelligent enough to obey simple commands, but not enough to be affected by politics. They are loyal to a master who has raised them and can trained and bred.  
Humanoid elementals are called **Jinn**. They live in the elemental planes in much the same way other humanoids inhabit their own planes, though they are more likely to cross over into other realms because of their magical nature, and because of that nature they are seen as powerful magical beings.

### Fey

Fey are magical creatures from either a liminal realm parallel to your primary material plane, or a parallel plane of existence all together. Fey are usually magical reflections or refractions of material realities, so they resemble terrestrials in many ways, but they are magical in nature. A jackolope, for example, resembles a hare, but it has antlers, and more importantly it can hop into ethereal space to escape capture. Crossings into the fey realms are liminal or reflective places such as pools of still water, mirrors in the dark, mirage oases, or the twilight of a thick canopied forest. You decide whether the feywild represents isolated ethereal regions of your prime material worlds, or is a single contiguous realm of its own. The fey and the feywild also have a strange relationship with time. The feywild may not exist at all times, its chronology may run in fits and starts, fey realms may be frozen in time, and its denizens are often unaging, or its visitors age extremely rapidly.

**Natural Abilities**  
Fey can pass through the ethereal boundaries of their homelands without issue. You can decide if this extends to the entire feywild, or only a specific realm, time or gate. Fey are universally magic and do not need to use spell focuses. Fey usually have innate spells that they can cast, and most fey creature rely on these spells instead of physical abilities, so a fey deer may turn invisible instead of running, and a fey coyote may enchant its prey instead of ambushing it.

**Sub-types**  
**Fell Beasts** are shadow-fey. They usually inhabit shadowy realms of the feywild, sometimes close to or bordering the realms of the undead. They harbor immense malice and hatred and are probably the closest things to truly evil creatures by nature. You may decide that the shadow realms constitute a separate realm from the feywild, or a realm within it, and the civilizations of your world may consider fell beasts to be evil fey or not fey at all, or an exact reflection of the good fey.  
Humanoid fey are **Elves**. They are usually considered aloof and could be a race of lone individuals that merely reflect human nature such as nymphs, or they could be a colonial empire rising out of the fey mists to rule the material plane benevolently or maliciously. Their natural magical abilities and ethereal nature usually instill awe and fear in other races

### Primordials

Primordials are the spirits of the material world that existed long before the arrival of the divines or the development of humanoids. Whether they predate the formation of the universe, created it themselves, or were created along with it, their time scale is beyond the ken of mere mortals. They often exist as paradigmatic spirit representations of other creatures. Their innate magical power, immense knowledge and wisdom, and meticulous approach to interacting with the world make them a source of awe and wonder, even in their most minute or banal forms.

**Natural Abilities**  
Primordials are naturally attached to their creature type and their locale. It is unheard of for a primordial to move from one place to another, and much more likely that if an environment becomes unsuitable for them they will transform into a monstrous and tyrannical form of themselves to turn the environment back. All primordials are primarily recon-based creatures, often with considerable magical power as well, and they usually resemble a chosen terrestrial in most physical abilities, though they are very frequently shape shifters.

**Sub-types**  
**Paragons** are the original, perfect archetypes of a species. There is usually only one paragon, though it sometimes has both a male and female body or can transform between the two. Paragons maximize all physical abilities of the species and often have additional magical qualities as well, even if they are the paragon of a species that is not naturally magical. Paragons are usually 5 levels higher than their offspring species at its peak and can be paragons of any species except constructs, divines or undead. It is said that the paragon of the Drakes, for example, is the dreaded Tiamat who slumbers beneath the universe and will rise one day to consume it all. A paragon that is defeated will usually emerge in a slightly new evolution meant to overcome whatever defeated the last one. Meanwhile, the species will wither and die, and a new one reflecting the new primordial will become dominant. Paragons can also be buried or otherwise restrained, causing them to go dormant and their species to go extinct until they are reawakened. The domestication of wild animals is done through the defeat or befriending of their paragon.  
**Land Spirits** are the embodiments of terrain features such as rivers, islands or glaciers. They can usually transform into the terrain in question at will and sometimes come into conflict with humanoids who would alter the land. They must be appeased or defeated, or else the land will refuse to change and the spirit may become wrathful. Similarly, these spirits can unexpectedly go dormant, or even shift their location slightly, causing massive upheaval for the creatures who rely on them. A land spirit that is defeated will usually be reborn in its new form as a protector of the new status-quo.  
**Humanoid primordials** are very uncommon. Primordials do not interact with factions on a daily basis, and do not typically act fast enough to keep up with politics. They usually take an entire day to take any action, and may slumber for a year or more at a time. 

### Undead

It’s important to keep in mind that the designation of undead in Round Table is meant to indicate the disembodied spirits of the formerly living, and not their re-animated bodies. Re-animated bodies are considered constructs. With that out of the way, undead can be understood as primarily ethereal creatures whose unlife is limited to their ability to acquire life force directly from the living. In this way undead are not evil, but their nature precludes them from interacting positively with living things. Anything living could be undead, but the undead tend to be rapidly anihilated by the chaotic process of dying. If they do somehow pull through unscathed, the undead cannot rest without taking their energy from the living and they are constant slaves to entropy in a much more acute way than the living are.

**Natural Abilities**  
Undead are ethereal in nature. With enough energy, they can sometimes summon a physical form. Undead can often possess creatures. Undead lose one energy every day that they persist. Once they are out of energy, they take wounds instead. Minor undead usually face this annihilation with no hope but to find a necromancer capable of giving them energy, however more powerful undead can extract energy from the living themselves.

**Sub-types**  
**Ashjar al-Jalad** are undead growths such as deathbed mosses, banshee mushrooms, waqwaq and zaqum trees or kelpies. They are growths that derive their energy from devouring the souls of the dead, and often use that energy to bind those souls, attracting more to die around them.  
**Vengeful Spirits** have a bone to pick. They have a singular goal which can provide them with a long rest, such as killing the children of a certain family, killing those who killed them, calling people to drown in the bog they drowned in, etc. After this goal is completed, they can rest and then rise at their full power once more to do it again. They may seem like humanoids because of their memories and complex mannerisms, but they are the hate that remains alive in the heart of a dead person. They cannot be reasoned with, and ignore all faction interactions. They are beasts hungry for their singular goal and nothing else.  
**Corporeal undead** have not been entirely disembodied. They use an ethereal or astral form to affect the outside world, but they are trapped in their body. If their body is destroyed, including through decomposition, they are annihilated. Corporeal undead who choose this fate usually mummify or otherwise preserve their bodies and keep them safely stored away. Corporeal undead looking for release will try to bring creatures to their body to destroy it. Unlike other undead, corporeal undead do not lose energy every day, though they cannot rest.  
Humanoid undead, or **Ghosts**, are fairly common, since it is most often humanoids who have devised a way to persist after their corporeal death. They retain all the memories of their life and usually still see the world from the paradigm of their living selves, so they tend to take forms and do things in ways that seem almost foolishly human. You may find a ghost walking, for example, even though its feet are incapable of touching the ground.

### Creature Sub-types

**Growths**  
Growths are mindless creatures that naturally spring up under certain circumstances and proliferate usually with only extremely small, nearly imperceptible movements. Growths cannot be enchanted, and they usually lack a lot of the senses of their type. For example, plants may not be able to see, smell, feel, and have no sense of balance or direction, etc. If a magic user is able to communicate with them, the information received could be extremely limited because the growth may not have taken in much information.

**Humanoids**  
Humanoids are creatures who can socialize. This means they are capable of faction interactions. Non-humanoids can neither defend nor attack using faction actions, and can only be attacked with them if the attack does not involve communicating with the victim. Even creatures capable of understanding words or commands such as dogs cannot be convinced with rhetoric, so a faction attack is limited to commanding the dog to do something simple but harmful, or getting another faction member to harm the dog. Similarly, screaming at a creature may be a faction attack to intimidate or frighten it, but you cannot use a faction ability such as persuasion on a creature such as a wolf. The designation of “humanoid” in no way directs other natural abilities such as speech or bipedalism. If you cannot communicate with another humanoid because of language barriers, you similarly cannot make faction interactions with them. Humanoids are considered to be humanoids and also whatever creature type they are naturally. There are no humanoids that are not another creature type. The humanoid creature type can be used to target any humanoids regardless of their companion creature type.

**Minions**  
Minions are simplified versions of creatures that don’t have the full list of skills and abilities that their more complex counterparts might. You should use minions to populate the general population of your world, such as deer. Minions are only proficient in one skill, and they are always one level below the lowest level of that tier. A wolf in a tier II forest then would most likely be level 6, with a \+6 in encounters, though one or two wolves in a pack will have martial skills instead. The Alpha wolf is probably not a minion, but a complex level 7 or 8 creature. Minions also have one ability related to their skill, which is usually what they are summoned or relied on for.

**Monstrosities**  
Monstrosities are combinations of creatures. Sometimes the combination is from within the same sub-type, such as a griffin which is a bird and lion, both beasts. Sometimes the combination stretches between sub-types such as a mermaid, both a beast and a fish (and also a humanoid), and sometimes it can be between two or more creature types such as a chimera, which is many parts terrestrial and one part draconid.   
Monstrosities can be created through magic intentionally or otherwise, or proliferate naturally. Monstrosities cannot be targeted as a creature type with spells or other abilities, but they are susceptible as members of all of the creature types to which they belong. For example, you cannot target a chimera by confining an attack to “monstrosities” but you can target it as either a terrestrial or a draconid successfully.  
Until the nature of a monstrosity is revealed, targeting the creature by type will be debuffed.  
Monstrosities generally balance their natural abilities between their various creature types, but usually fall prey to a stacking up of weaknesses rather than benefit from a stacking up of strengths. Thus it is not guaranteed that a winged monstrosity can fly, but it is likely that a monstrous terrestiral will lack magical abilities. Monstrosities can be individual humanoids, and monstrous cultures can exist such as snake-people, satyrs, centaurs etc.

**Shapeshifters**  
Shapeshifters are creatures whose natural form allows them to shapeshift into other forms. They have a single natural form, which they often must transform into between transformations, rest in, and revert to when incapacitated, amputated, or dead. Such transformation, though a natural ability, usually takes considerable energy. They have clear tells in all their forms that identify them as shapeshifters, and the shapeshifter category and their natural creature type can be used to target them with spells and abilities, but an assumed creature type cannot. For example, if a shapeshifting dragon appears as a deer, hunting it as a terrestrial will fail because it is a shapeshifter and a dragon, not a terrestrial.  
Shapeshifters can only transform into forms that are of a lower level than their natural form.  
They gain no benefit from transforming back and forth, such as healing or restoring energy. Shapeshifters can only transform into non-shapeshifter creatures that they have seen, or in very rare cases, non-shapeshifter objects they have seen.

**Swarms**  
Swarms are groups of creatures that behave communally. They communicate with one another in an extremely organized and fast way, without individuality. This allows each member of a swarm to act as an appendage to the swarm itself, but they cannot make individual judgements. A swarm is a single creature with multiple manifestations or bodies, such as a school of fish. The swarm behaves fundamentally differently than the individual and will have a different stat block than the individual. A member of a swarm who is not in current communication with the swarm is considered and individual. For this reason, environmental and magical attacks that impact swarm communication can dissolve a swarm without impacting individuals.

## The Section Detailing Different Terrain Types {#the-section-detailing-different-terrain-types}

### Common Environments

These are places that are friendly to human habitation, and so places where humans tend to frequent. You will find them as the core environments of your settings, especially in the early levels. Because they are easy to tame and live in, exploring and crossing them is trivial, low-tier business that many people do.

**Forest** environments are characterized by the complete domination of trees in temperate climates. These trees create a microclimate within a forest, changing the very weather, and are the primary concern of just about every other creature in the forest. The forest floor offers new clues for tracking prey, but may conceal common clues such as footprints. Waterways are often somewhat subject to the forest, being pushed around by fallen trees, and food sources including both plants and animals must live within the trees’ domain. An amateur might think a campfire can go unnoticed in a forest, not realizing that from below you cannot see the smoke signal, but from a few kilometres away it is clear as day. All these hazards must be carefully navagated by those who wish to become masters of the forest.  
A character trained in the forest terrain passes through the terrain of a forest floor as natural movement. They are also naturally capable of climbing trees, poles and other similar surfaces.

**Urban** environments are characterized by the alterations that humanoids have made to the natural setting. Whether they are human cities, kobold warrens or even dense farmland, creatures in an urban environment can hardly escape humanoid architecture. It takes a special mix of skills to make your way in an urban environment. Unlike natural worlds there is most often a great abundance of everything a humaniod might need to prosper, but this abundance is guarded behind norms, laws, social constructs and factions. An excellent urban ranger can find the commonalities between disparate peoples to earn or make their living in any urban centre, and even track people on the trackless cobblestones.  
A character trained in urban terrain can pass through crowds, debris and unusual terrain such as rooftops that would normally constitute reckless movment as their natural movement. They can also climb walls and buildings, and maneuver small gaps, drops, and squeezes such as windows and other barriers caused by urban development.

Whether it is the vast sahel, the steppe or the great prairie, enormous **Grasslands** can stretch for thousands of kilometers and constitute oceans or continents in their own right. It takes a skilled person to find sufficient food in this harsh environment, and often requires hunting large game over many miles. Moving unnoticed in steeply cut creek beds or badlands, and tracking those that do the same also requires a keen eye for life on the grasslands.  
Those trained in grasslands can move great distances with ease. Your natural strategic speed is 10km, the same as a horse. You can also ride one type of mount as natural movement.

Whether they are cold northern bogs or sweltering mangrove forests, Mediterranean reed deltas, or the bayou, **Swamps** represent areas where the ground and fresh water are mixed at the surface. They contain treacherous quicksands and mires and dangerous predators lurking in their shifting landscapes. Staying dry can be a life-or-death struggle as water swells from the skies above and the rising and twisting rivers below, and no assurance can be made that crossing once offers safe passage back. Those trained to move through swamps can swim and move naturally through shallow water, mud, and slippery surfaces.

Along the **Coast**, the land points toward the sea, and the sea points to the land as well. There is a place there, where the streams flow and the waves crash. The coastal environment is both of these places, land and water. The water is whatever is over 1km across, be it the ocean, a sea, a large lake, or even a very wide river. That water is the coast, and so too is the land around it. The interface is famously bountiful. And this bounty draws dangers. Huge sea storms crash onto land. Creatures grown massive from their terrestrial domains come to water. And many creatures live in this liminal place, caught in between.  
Those trained in coastal areas are naturally capable of swimming and wading through water, as well as remaining sure footed on watercraft.

Those unfamiliar with the **Shield** environment might use the word “boulder”, but what about when a rock is over 500m to a side? The shield is characterized first and foremost by granite and the landscape is dominated by the bedrock. This means whatever vegetation grows on tops has little purchase, and prefers the midland areas where dirt and debris has collected to form a thin suitable soil. The lower areas are covered in water, for it cannot drain through the rock, leaving innumerable irregularly shaped waterways which can often not be categorized easily as lakes or rivers. Crossing and recrossing these waterways is necessary, as is scampering over the occasional bare granite cliff. While the shield contains a suitable supply of food and an enormous amount of fresh water, its true bounty is in minerals, where all manner of gems and precious metals can be found in the innumerable granite outcroppings, and massive deposits lie just below the surface or underneath a lake.  
Those trained in the Shield can both climb and swim as natural movement.

### Inhospitable Environments

There are many places on the periphery of civilization that are too rugged for the common folk. They can be crossed with some danger, and small, specialized groups call them home permanently. When designing your world, you can separate areas using these inhospitable environments, then you can build links through them using more favorable terrain. For example, a chain of islands allow the coast to cut through an open ocean, a lush river valley spotted with swamps, grasslands and extensive farms creates a highway through a desert.

The cacophony of wildlife fills the world around the **Desert**, but nothing prepares visitors for the silence, the stillness, the death. Deserts can be filled with sand or rocks, or salt, or any other minerals. They can stretch for thousands of kilometers and offer nothing to those who would attempt to survive among them.  
Those trained to navigate deserts can see naturally in very bright light, and live, and take short rests in heat and cold. They can move naturally over shifting terrain and sand.

The steep cliffs and rugged sides of a **Mountain** break suddenly to reveal jagged peaks, barren slopes and glacier caps. Mountain landscapes can rise out of familiar terrain to reveal an alien world. They can jut out of a tropical jungle to plunge adventurers into snow and ice, or rise to such height that the air thins, the body weakens, and the organs simply fail. You can walk until your legs collapse beneath you, only to find you have crossed little more than a kilometer in a day, and yet a mountain range can stretch for hundreds of kilometers, cutting off otherwise close neighbors.  
Trained mountaineers have developed larger lungs that allow them to breathe naturally in air too thin for others. They can also move across snow, slopes and cliffs as natural movement.

The open **Ocean** is frequently seen as the most dangerous terrain that is naturally found in the world. It is a place wholly alien to humanity. What occurs beyound the misty blue line of the horizon, on a continent of water with towering waves, is beyond the imagination of most. Even there, rain is the only drinkable water, and the fish that are made into food can also present themselves as massive sharks. Whales evade dragons between the waves, so what hope does a land lover have of surviving here?  
Those trained for life on the open ocean can naturally swim. They are also able to rest in open water by floating on their backs, and can find sure footing on watercraft.

The **Jungle** is not like a forest. Where the huge trees modify the terrain and environment of a forest, the trees and plant life constitute a terrain in the jungle. You cannot move without stepping on the massive root structures of trees and pushing through thick vegetation. Frequently, the jungle floor does not see sunlight for years at a time as it is blotted out by the towering, thick canopy. Jungles frequently contain impassable vegitative structures, and the actual topography of travel through the jungle is dictated more by living and fallen trees and other plants than it is by the natural rise and fall of the land. Forests can modify the climate, but jungles can contain microclimates between their canopy and floor unlike what is experienced outside them.  
Those trained in jungle terrain are able to climb and pass over slippery terrain or that obstructed by vegetation as natural movement, and swim.

There are lands in the natural world that plunge below the freezing point of water periodically, but one of the most alien landscapes is the **Frozen** places of the world that only rarely rise to melting temperatures. When they are warmest, these places see snowfall, not rain, and when they are coldest, it’s too cold even to snow. Mammals who live here must seek refuge in huge fat supplies and shelter from the cold. Insects are rare, birds migrate away, and the land is left desolated. Starvation is unlikely only because the sheer cold is almost sure to kill you first. Even in the warm seasons, ice is found on glaciers, on the surface of the water, and a few inches below the ground.  
Those trained in Frozen encounters can take short rests while cold, see in extremely bright and dim light, and pass naturally over slippery terrain and snow.

### The Unseen Worlds

There are places that are not connected by direct geography, but through the ethereal veil that covers the world and permeates it with magical energies. When creating a world you should decide if the unseen worlds constitute whole planes of existence, geographically connected to themselves, or pockets where these strange places exist, or some combination. Also decide whether or not these locations can co-exist. Can an area that experiences a connection with the Feywild also be connected to the Deep? Can one travel from the Primordial realms to Abqaria without passing through the mortal world? Travel to the unseen worlds is also dictated by distinct circumstances, but powerful magic users can forge links to them outside these conditions.

The Land of Genius, the abode of the Muses, the City of Jinn, **Abqaria** is an expansive realm that rests on the state of aloofness and distraction one finds in deep thought, flow or inspiration. It is found when one loses their interest or grip on the mortal world, and so can often be discovered simply by an impassioned and driven seeking of it. Its entire sky is luminous in an even white light, blinding to behold and never dimming. Its inhabitants are elementals that can turn ethereal and fly at will, making doors and passages unnecessary. Though its wilderness is an endless and featureless desert with no food or water, it is spotted with oases of incredible luxury and marvelous works: Kasbahs. These are fortified cities of craftspeople, artists, magicians and inventors that are usually very progressive, and their aloof and fortified nature as well as powerful inhabitants allow them to stand against the covetous mortal factions that would tear them apart to feast on their riches.  
Someone trained in Abqari encounters can move over sand naturally, can rest in hot weather and see through bright light as well as see elementals who have made themselves ethereal.

Beyond the touch of sunlight lies the **Deep**. Whether it is a jungle floor enshrouded in perpetual darkness, a subterranean labyrinth, or the Midnight Zone of the open ocean, the Deep represents all that lies beyond the reach of natural light. There are tales of ancient and treacherous passages under mountains or even under seas, caves with no up or down, even subterranean worlds complete with jungles and intelligent life, and yet, to most, these remain cautionary tales against shunning the light of the sun, not directions to adventure. Transitions into the Deep are dark passages that seem to flicker or disappear in direct lighting.  
Those trained in the Deep can squeeze, climb and move across debris and slippery terrain naturally as well as see in dim light.

The Land of the Fae, Alfheimr, the **Feywild** is the homeland of the fey creature type. It is perpetually dark, with no sun, but a very large and luminous moon as well as frequent auroras that descend from the sky to ground level, thus illuminating it with dim light. The large trees that cover the Feywild use this dim light to grow extremely slowly, creating exotic and extremely dense woods. These forests are populated by fey creatures as well as frequent Terrestrial and Cthonite visitors. Parts of the Feywild are also associated with the afterlife of certain terrestrial humanoids, who rise in the Feywild after they die in the mortal realms. Passages to the Feywild must be dimly lit, usually by twilight or dawn, and they are often found at gates such as standing stones or cairns that physically manifest the passing from the mortal world to elsewhere. These passages can also be naturally occurring places that represent that change, such as the edge of a dark forest or swamp, or the boundary of a thick fog.  
Those trained in the Feywild can see in dim light and pass through vegetation and shallow water naturally. They can also see fey or undead who have attempted to make themselves invisible.

The land of one thousand islands is the sea or perhaps the inverted archipelago of seas that exists in the liminal space called **Manatuana**. Virtually every land near water speaks of a moving island, or an island that rises and falls at certain times of year, or the island to which the spirits of the dead are ushered. These islands all together constitute Manatuana, the plane of liminal islands. Usually these islands have ports between them, and they can be travelled as easily as any other island chain, however each island has only one tether to the mortal world, one condition under which people may travel to and from Manatuana. Perhaps the condition of one island is that it can only be found by the undead, and travelling back takes place on one specific day of the year. Perhaps its neighboring island appears in the eye of a hurricane every June. Perhaps another can be sought out any time of the year, but only found after one has permission from a certain primordial. Whatever the condition of the gate to the mortal realms, it is usually enough to dissuade most travelers and earn the skepticism of the rest.  
Those trained in Manatuana can naturally move on water vessels and can swim.

Some say the world was once roamed only by primoridals, and that they created **Primordial Realms** for one another that now constitute various other environments. But sometimes, in places widely understood as sacred, a path will open to reveal a realm untouched by all that has transpired since this ancient time. If this primordial land’s guardian is peaceful, such a bountiful garden can seem to be a sublime Eden, and sometimes humanoids contrive a fate such that they will rise undead in these beautiful places once they die. If, on the other hand, this realm’s sovereign is wrathful, a profound darkness seeps from this wound and contaminates the neighboring realms, and the primordial environment itself is a wasteland of polluted land, water and air, and its creatures are wretched abominations.  
Those trained to walk primordial realms are natural acrobats who can leap, swing, and climb as natural movement. They can also naturally recognize a primordial who has shapeshifted or otherwise taken a more mundane form.

## The Appendix of Generic Skills That You Assumed Would Have Been in their Respective Chapters But Isn’t, Also a Background {#the-appendix-of-generic-skills-that-you-assumed-would-have-been-in-their-respective-chapters-but-isn’t,-also-a-background}

### Generic Background: The Outsider

While most backgrounds are intrinsically linked to the setting and therefore cannot be generic, the Outsider represents someone who lives as an outsider individually, not as an out-group or from another place. They are local but for whatever reason they are aloof and somewhat clueless to the society that surrounds them. This could be the result of their own intrinsic qualities such as a hermetic disposition, or it could be the result of social pressure pushing them out, perhaps because of a feature or disability. First, decide why your character is an Outsider, then align their other attributes with the regular society that your table establishes, keeping the unique attribute that pairs with their other-ness.

#### You likely have an ordinary **name** for your society, but are known by your reclusiveness, for example “Bunker Tom”. If shunned by society, you might be known primarily for the reason you are shunned.

You may have a distinctive **physical appearance** that may be tied to your reclusiveness, such as a prominent birthmark that you hide with a mask.  
People may recognize something unique in your **auditory cue** as you use outdated slang, or no slang at all, and possibly mispronounce words you have only ever read, talk to yourself, or use the wrong volume when speaking.  
**Independent Mind**  
Your years of solitude may not prepare you well for some social situations, but they also mean you instinctively come to your own conclusions rather than relying on others and ask questions that are often avoided. 

* You gain \+1 intel point whenever you hit with an investigation of a faction.

**Abilities**  
You can acquire the following abilities regardless of your arenas of play, adding your proficiency bonus to them. You do not automatically get all these abilities, but can take them as you level up by spending 1 levelling point each if you choose  
.

* **Quiet Presence** You are proficient in maneuvering without being seen.  
* **Legend Lore** You gain the Major Arcanum Legend.  
* **Magic Shy** You gain the Arcane Veil Minor Arcanum.  
* **Secret Place** You can establish a safehouse as a personal asset.  
* **Without A Trace** You are proficient in recon checks to hide.

### Generic Martial Skill: The Brawler

A brawler is an informally trained martial artist focusing on hand-to-hand and practical combat skills. They are often focused on their own safety and security, with a philosophy that projecting violence can keep you from being victimized by it.  
You are proficient with everyday weapons that don’t carry social stigmas or restrictions, usually hunting implements and self defense weapons.  
You are also proficient when engaging in wresting or hand-to-hand combat.  
You are proficient in tactical maneuvers that allow you to execute a violent action on the same turn.  
You are proficient in brawling; brutal fist-fighting and wrestling sport matches that are won by the first to inflict a minor condition.

### Generic Magic Skills: The Scholar

Each school of magic has devotees. Whether it is a family or cultural fascination or reputation with a specific school, a personal interest, or simply a lack of options, people commonly develop a lopsided view of the magical arts in favour of their particular school. The Scholar is someone who studies a particular school of magic that you choose.  
Whenever you learn a Major Arcanum from your specialist school, you can choose to add 1e to its energy requirement and modify any 1 characteristic by 1 step, for example adding a target or reducing the casting time from one minute to one action.  
You are proficient with the use of magic Books and Cards.  
You can use the Auxiliary Minor Arcanum, expending 1e to add yourself as the target of a friendly spell.

### Generic Faction Skill: The Diplomat

Wherever there are two factions, or even one faction and non-members, there must be people to go between them and help with communication and trade. Diplomats are naturally empathetic and charismatic, but also somewhat aloof and independent.  
You can be considered to be a member in good standing of any number of factions, even if they are hostile to eachother. Your relation with any faction member starts off as whatever is plausible and most favourable, rather than most likely.  
When you are carrying a message or directive from anyone else, you can use that as leverage so long as you are acting directly in scope of delivering that message or directive.  
When undertaking a long rest, you become aware of all the factions that openly operate in your locale.

### Recon Generic Skills

While the specific skills of the other 3 arenas of play are particular to your setting, the recon skills that rely on expertise in the terrain or creature types are universal to all settings. There is an additional class of Recon skills that represent expertise in a specific region, which of course must be unique to a setting, and therefore will be released in official content. 

**Terrain Experts and Survivalists**  
When adding this as your character’s skill, specify if they are an expert in Forest, Urban, Grassland, Swamp, Coast or Shield common terrain, for example “Coast Terrain Expert”. Alternatively, specify that they are a survivalist of Desert, Mountain, Ocean, Jungle, or Frozen inhospitable terrain , for example, “Desert Survivalist”.  
You have a **large pack** that you can give out to another party member that allows them to convert supply to materials specific to your expertise, such as a piton for mountain terrain. It carries 5 supply.  
You are proficient in all **strategic movement and maneuvers** detailed in the specified terrain type and gain natural movement described there.  
You are proficient in all **checks and saves** dealing directly with the specified terrain, for example, recon saves while you are in your specialized terrain or checks to find things there.  
You can always convert **supply** to specific items dealing with the terrain in question, for example sunglasses for desert terrain, an axe for forest terrain, etc. Even when you are not in the specified terrain.  
You are proficient with all mechanical **mounts and vehicles** that specify their utility in the specified terrain type.

#### Unseen Realms Travelers

When adding this as your character’s skill, specify if they are an expert in Abqaria, the Deep, the Feywild, Manatuana or the Primordial realms.  
You have a **magic bell** or other indicator that rings when it touches an outsider from the specified realm or when it first enters a locale with an open portal to that realm.  
You are proficient with **intel checks** to identify that a creature comes from your specified realm, as well as such checks to locate and learn about crossover locations, times and other relevant information to crossing into your specified realm.   
You are proficient in all **strategic movement and maneuvers** detailed in the specified terrain type and gain natural movement described there.  
You are proficient in all **checks and saves** dealing directly with the specified terrain, for example, recon saves while you are in your specialized terrain or checks to find things there.  
You are proficient with **mounts and vehicles** originating in your specified terrain type.

#### Creature Experts

When adding this as your character’s skill, specify if they are an expert in terrestrials, constructs, cthonites, divines, draconids, elementals, fey, primordials or undead, for example, “Undead Expert”.  
You have a large pack that you can give out to other party members allowing them to convert supply to specific mundane items relevant for finding, identifying, or perceiving the creature type in question.  
You are proficient with all **martial and recon checks and saves** made targeting a creature of the type you specify.  
You are proficient in **riding mounts** that are also creatures of your specified type.  
You are proficient with a specific type of **common weapon or equipment** that is established in your setting to be used against your target creature type such as a spear, rifle or camera.  
You are proficient in **intel checks** to find information about any species of the type you specify, though not necessarily information about individuals. For example, a terrestrial expert might be able to identify all the possible colours of cows (one data point), but that doesn’t give any information about the colour of a specific cow.

## Building Sessions and Campaigns, The Section that is Actually for the GMs {#building-sessions-and-campaigns,-the-section-that-is-actually-for-the-gms}

### The Simple Summary

You can read the next sections to get into the deeper theory, but here’s the sum of it:

* The GM never arbitrates higher or lower difficulties to represent easier or harder challenges or more dangerous creatures.  
* Number of required checks is the measure of difficulty, set above and below the sum of character levels.  
* Number of economic units that the opposition uses per long rest should always equal the sum of character levels in the party.  
* The GM tracks progression of the party through the session and campaign, using creatures, factions and geographies as the appendages of their own fates.

### Base Difficulty.

The GM never arbitrates higher base difficulties or skill bonuses to artificially create a more difficult situation. The mathematical reasoning for this is complex, but effectively, it doesn’t work. Consider the extremes to get a general idea of the problem: with a \+1, a level 1 character has a 0% chance of ever having a result above 13\. If you artificially bulk a creature’s passive martial skill to 8, that means your level 1 character could never harm that target. This is part of the Tiers of Play, Folk Fantasy, and Fate core tenets of the game. A level 1 character should not, in fact, be put in a situation where they are meant to do harm to a level 8 opponent. While they could theoretically of course simply shoot them, the contraventions of fate and the basic premise of non-heroism prevent it in the game. For a character to get into a situation where they would face down that level 8 creature, they need to challenge their status; they need to change their fate (to level up a few times first).  
In order to do that, characters always face obstacles that are on their level. It can be assumed that obstacles that are in line with their station and fate are always the same level that they are. Fighting lower level monsters is not rewarding, fighting higher level monsters is just pride taking a run at you.

### So how do GMs control difficulty in Round Table?

So what does it take to disable a level 1 minion? One action. Any action really, it could be a spell, a convincing argument, a well placed punch, or sneaking around them. If the party is clever, they will figure out the arena that the minion uses, and counter it in an intelligent way. The key is that if the opponent and challenges match the party’s level (give or take 1 level), each challenge will jeopardize a type of game currency: Social Credit, Energy, or Supply. These currencies are made interchangeable by the game’s mechanics, which means the basic economic unit of the game is the Long Rest, where Social Credit and Energy are restored completely, and many abilities refresh to allow them to be exchanged once again. The Long Rest represents the Supply side of the economy of challenge difficulty. In a long rest for a starter party, 2-3 units per character are restored.   
The game is automatically balanced such that any same-level challenge faced by the party statistically presents the party with the choice of two dice: one above the challenge difficulty and one below. This means, in order to succeed at any given challenge, the party must expend 1e per roll. The dice are fickle, sometimes you roll under twice or above twice, but as long as you keep rolling, the statistics will allow for the ebb and flow of luck while maintaining a general sense of challenge.  
In practice, rolling fewer than 8 times per long rest is statistically insignificant for a table. There are not enough iterations of the economy simulation to get a predictable result. That’s why your typical party starts with 4 level 1 characters: 8 energy.  
They also have Supply and Social Credit, which is the key feature of player agency in the game. Your party must diversify and swap their resources to succeed.  
As the party increases in level, you add additional challenges per long rest to reflect 6-10 additional rolls. The GM (and to a lesser extent the table as a whole) should also keep a general idea of the entire party’s economy, increasing risks or rewards appropriately.  
Remember: because the in-game currencies are interchangeable mathematically, you only need to deplete any one of them, and allow the party to figure out how to exchange them. For example if it takes one energy to succeed at climbing a cliff, and the risk is that you drop some gear and lose 1 supply, you don’t need to do anything to balance the game. The challenge automatically expends one economic unit from the party whether they succeed or fail. But they still have plenty of agency to use other abilities or methods to circumvent the challenge. In this way, the GM doesn’t have to overthink anything, or rebalance after a breakthrough or loss from the party. Just keep going. You just need to reach statistical balance.  
Example:  
You know that just gaining control of a grapple requires one economic unit, whether they roll it, do magic, use an item, sneak, etc. They will statistically spend one economic unit. You start an encounter by having an opponent physically grab one of the players. Now they are in a clinch. The party has already spent something. The purpose of the clinch is so that another opponent can try to steal 1 supply from the party. Now they have spent two economic units. No matter what they do to overcome the theft, they statistically spend something to do it. A third opponent is trying to distract the party while this is happening. That’s 3\. Any time anyone is rolling the dice, statistically they will buff that roll with something. In this example, in a single round, over the course of seconds, a level 1 party has jeopardized half their available resources for the day. If you leave it there, and call that a day, it is entirely up to the dice whether or not the party succeeds or fails. They can buff every roll, knowing there are no consequences because they will never run out of energy.   
You must run a number of challenges that make the outcome statistically unlikely to succeed in order to give your players the agency to make the decisions needed to achieve their goals, otherwise they are not agents in their own success.

### Opponent Economy

The party has an economy based on the sum of their supply, energy and Social Credit. Their opponents also have access to supply, energy and social credit, however it would be impossible and ultimately futile to track it for each opponent. Instead, the relevant question is how many resources are the sum of the opponents willing and able to level against the party? As an example, an unknown group of rowdy adventurers making noise in a bar might not merit expending even one energy or social credit to attempt to quiet them down, even if an opposing creature has those resources in reserve. So the GM is left with a number of resources that the sum of opponents are *willing* to expend before they basically just let the party get away with something. Keep in mind, every creature and every faction is living an entire life in Round Table. Precisely because the world does not revolve around the party, opponents are quick to retreat, unwilling to expend resources against them, and perhaps already in a deficit because of some unexplained occurrence before the party showed up.  
When you set out a campaign, plan for a number of resources equal to the sum of levels of all party members to be expended between each of the party’s long rests. It’s simplified but effective. If you find that your party is looking for more of a challenge, increase the number. If they are wanting a cozier game, reduce it. Whenever an opponent buffs a roll or uses an ability that requires energy, social credit or supply, deduct it from the total opponent resources.  
There are two explanations for Opponent Economy within Round Table. The first is that the party is travelling along their fate trajectory, and fate has something in store for them. The subtle ebb and flow of the Veil of magic that surrounds the world empowers creatures to expend resources against the party, or holds them back. A number of such resources is expended along the way that is governed by forces beyond the ken of those creatures and factions which expend them. The second explanation, and the one which the party should encounter, is the explanation that people give in support of this “greater plan”. They are tired, sick, in a bad mood, just plain don’t like the cut of the party’s jibb. Everyone has a reason for everything that is tied into their regular daily lives, only a few notice the pattern from one challenge to the next.

### Designing Sessions

Sessions are the basic unit of play, they are the meeting in which the players play the game. They should ideally follow a structure to be engaging and reduce the amount of floating data points that need to be picked up at a later session, tying everything into a neat bow to be re-opened at a later date, but pulling this off is difficult. Sessions are best designed if they are focused on a single item that moves the plot forward. Sessions can be based around any focus point, but here are some places to start:

* A travel montage  
* Exploring a new faction  
* Exploring a locale in depth  
* Finding information for next steps  
* A character’s fate challenge  
* Introduction of a key NPC  
* Moving a player’s plot forward  
* Establishing a new region  
* Exploring a specific game mechanic  
* Exploring a philosophical question  
* Recovering from a permanent injury

To design a session, look to your overall adventure plan, and cut out a concise piece that includes a number of different challenges, sometimes as few as 1 or 2 is sufficient. Consider how much time you have to play, how many players there are, what you are trying to accomplish, how often your table gets side-tracked.

### Adventures

Adventures are a series of sessions planned out to achieve a specific goal within a broader setting and with room for everyone to contribute and explore. Importantly, they can be understood as the unit between long rests, which is key to planning. They are often broadly based on similar premises as sessions and can be as short as one session, but with a more general approach. For example, an adventure to travel across several regions may include many sessions dealing with exploration, travel and the associated obstacles, not to mention character development and fate challenges. Adventures are usually the unit that individual characters play along, starting new at the beginning of the adventure and dying or retiring as their end. Adventures may be built around any of the following:

* Levelling the entire party up  
* Exploring the interplay of various regions and factions in the setting  
* Developing changes to the setting  
* Very long distance travel  
* The establishment of a new faction and its repercussions  
* Acquiring a legendary treasure

To design an adventure, develop a conceit for why your party cannot take a long rest during the adventure segment, for example planning for the removal of accommodations or the introduction of creatures attempting to ambush them. The simplest reason is that the events take place within an 8 hour time span. Next, split the adventure up into a number of checks equal to the total number of levels in the party. You can collect these checks into complex challenges, for example using 2-3 checks to climb a difficult cliff face, or facing 4 opponents of the same level (8 checks). Lay these checks out narratively, considering fail states, but not worrying too much about work-arounds. For example, make sure you know the consequences of failing the checks when climbing the cliff, but don’t worry too much about the party finding another way around the cliff (just do 3 checks when they do that). Make sure the checks are interesting things that your party likes to do, challenges them, hasn’t done before, takes advantage of some new equipment, etc.  
You can lay out your adventure in a checklist, if that helps. Then just try to walk the party along their fate and see how hard it is to herd cats. For this reason, you should use stated interests and motivations of your players as the core plotline.

### Campaigns

Campaigns are years-long series of adventures that come together to thoroughly develop many characters per player, many regions and factions, and everything in between. Campaigns often explore world-changing events and their effects on the people of a setting, or themes of certain philosophical questions like the nature of humanity. Campaigns are generally not built around player characters, and players are encouraged to change characters and roles regularly. You can start designing a campaign by putting together one or two adventure ideas, but they should emerge organically one adventure at a time from your table.

## The Design Section, Which is not Only for GMs {#the-design-section,-which-is-not-only-for-gms}

### Designing at a Round Table

Round Table games are designed by the Table, not by the GM. We would be honoured to be invited to your table to contribute official content to help guide your game and provide you tools. Along with this rule book and official content, the GMs role is to facilitate play by designing and managing content, not necessarily arbitrating on rules. Players can take on lots of different roles, but the most common way to interact with the game is as a character player.   
Your character doesn’t end abruptly within an individual identity. A person is the sum of the people who make them. All players are encouraged to establish and integrate deep links between their characters and the world including factions, locales and other setting lore that is important to them. Many rules do not need to be arbitrated by the GM, but can be proposed and run by the player themselves. If you are familiar enough with the rules, for example, you can propose and play through an entire challenge with your other players, the GM is meant to chime in to help play run smoothly, voice and play adversarial roles, and manage the content that is accessed and established by the players.  
Be sure to meet new players at their level. Youths might need help with math and organization. Those new to RPGs might need help with getting into character and playing the role instead of the numbers. Those new to tabletops might need help interpreting desires and actions as mechanics. Those new to Round Table might need help with collaboratively taking the reins when establishing setting elements and outcomes.

### Designing Folk Fantasy

Round Table games are about ordinary people facing challenges in a fantastic setting. To achieve this aesthetic, it’s important to consider the overall setting before deciding how individual characters fit into it. Society and factions are paramount, and obstacles are almost always the result of a lack of consideration for the players characters, rather than in opposition to them. For example, the appearance of an evil magician seeking to ennsslave the players’ characters’ families is a call to heroics. In Round Table you can instead create a similar danger by introducing a powerful drake, simply looking to eat, unconcerned with the fact that it is trying to eat player characters. Not every single obstacle or conflict is centred on mindless beasts and the environment, but society and individuals are often just as callous.  
It may not be for everyone, but the question asked in Round Table is not “what if I could fly” but rather more subtly, “what if I could achieve my goals without flying?” Instead of super-powered characters fighting super-powered monsters, folk fantasy imagines a world where you don’t need to be a mythical hero to achieve basic justice in an unforgiving world, you just need eachother.

### Table Rules to Adjust the Tone and Difficulty

You can add a number of table rules to adjust the tone of the game and the difficulty.   
Tone is the overall sensation of playing the game, including table culture, characters, plotlines, etc. Some rules can be adjusted to enhance this aspect of gameplay while also relying on communicating the expectations and desires of the players to achieve a certain tone.  
You can achieve a more **Grim** tone by making permanent injuries more common, focusing on Cthonite creatures and cynical cults, making the fey alien and unknowable creatures of twilight, make use of undead often, and use the indifferent relation more frequently for the general public, as well as increasing the overall difficulty.  
You can dip into **Horror** by making permanent injuries and possession more common, and making use of enchantments, corporeal undead, revenant constructs, and Cthonites. Rely on sudden ambushes, jump-scares and use martial and magic attacks to cause merciless critical injuries with no warning, especially from creatures well suited to hiding.  
A **Post-Apocalyptic** game can focus on inventory management, making supply scarce and balancing the game between faction dynamics with other survivors and recon dynamics to find resources and avoid whatever caused the apocalypse. Constantly run supply levels down to prevent long rests, then use waves of attacks from both creatures and other survivors.  
A **high-fantasy** feel might focus on humanoids of other creature types like Jinn and Elves, with very powerful non-humanoid draconids and other monsters carving out large, wild lands between highly developed urban centres. Bestow quests directly to the party from faction authorities like sheriffs or knights to travel to distant lands or defeat creatures menacing the borders of the wildlands.  
Your game can focus on **Intrigue** by formulating complex networks of individuals operating within factions to try to achieve goals in a setting where both magic and martial violence are heavily restricted.  
You can create a **Bottle Episode** by restricting an entire session or short adventure to a single locale, such as a ship, island, moving train, etc.  
You can create a **Cozy** game experience by focusing on helping factions succeed and cooperate with eachother, restore members to good standing, and find resources with an emphasis on exploration of the natural world and social structures through elaborate descriptions.  
Your game will become more **Zany** if you increase the frequency of temporary injuries, are more permissive with faction expectations and relations, and focus on memes and jokes such as character mash-ups, pop-culture references.

Difficulty is meant to describe the level of expertise required from the players to achieve their fate challenges and general play, and is therefore mostly a function of how many resources need to be used on average per challenge. Increasing difficulty may have the effect of making a game more granular or serious in tone as well.

* Increase difficulty by allowing players to engage in extensive side-bars and distractions without providing resources or bringing them back to the plot.  
* Decrease difficulty by allowing players to take a 12 whenever it appears, without having to buff their roll.  
* Increase difficulty by taxiing the party through equipment loss or failure whenever they keep a 1, regardless of the result of the roll.  
* Decrease difficulty by allowing players to sum doubles as their total roll (so if they roll 8-8, it is as if they rolled 16).  
* Increase difficulty by hounding the party with permanent injuries and hostile individuals and factions, requiring extensive side-bars to rectify these situations without bonus resources.  
* Decrease difficulty by providing loot drops in the form of supply and items frequently.  
* Increase difficulty by setting more strict requirements for resting, such as 12 or even 24 hour time requirements for long rests, cooking food, etc.

### Roles

Players should not strictly fall into any one role in Round Table but rather should take on whatever needs to be done in accordance with their ability. A great voice actor doesn’t need to restrict themselves to only voicing their character. Someone who knows the rules well should clarify them for everyone. Someone who loves inventory management could manage the entire party’s inventory all the time. What follows are a few guidelines to provide tools for tables to run effectively and fit into the culture of Round Table play.

#### Character Players

Character players are the only absolutely necessary role in Round Table. Each one usually manages one character, who is not strictly limited to the individual but also includes background connections to the setting such as locales and factions that are integral to the character. They may also manage affiliated characters like minions, character assets, family members, etc. The key is that a character player has a deep and setting-informed understanding of the character, allowing for interesting interactions and deep role play.

#### Game Manager

The game manager is not an arbitrator on the rules, but rather a facilitator. The game manager uses brief information from the players about their characters and associated  setting elements, as well as the players’ stated goals for the game to design compelling adventures and campaigns. You don’t necessarily need a GM in order to play an individual session, especially if the majority of the design work is already laid out by official content or the context of the larger campaign, GMs are there to create and maintain consistent and compelling setting for characters to explore and grow.

#### Faction Manager

You may have one player, especially who is less familiar with the rules or more interested in narrative and intrigue, run the factions of a setting or run an individual faction instead of a single character.

#### Adventure/Session Manager

Having a player drop in to manage an individual setting or adventure within a larger campaign is a great way to introduce players to GMing, or even introduce new players to the game as a whole. Because the role of GM is focused on managing the overall flow of the game, players themselves can usually step in to clarify individual mechanics and rules, allowing the session manager to focus on understanding how it all fits together.

## Design Section of Various Elements of Round Table Games

### Designing Backgrounds

Backgrounds should be integrated deeply into your setting, reflecting diverse cultural experiences even within the same culture and should not be used to stereotype. They are profound identity markers that should fit into your setting and give it depth, helping to make each character unique.  
Backgrounds give options and suggestions for personality traits such as appearance, auditory cue and downtime activities. They describe a paradigm and what characters perceive as normal.  
A background will feature a unique ability, adapted from one of the abilities found in the four arenas of play that gives a moderate mechanical nuance to the way a character with that background is used to interacting with the world. It is often a slightly more specific version of another ability, but should not be made redundant by a character also having a related skill.  
Lastly, a background includes 5 additional abilities, usually copied directly from those found in the other arenas. This gives each character access to a few abilities outside their arena of play by virtue of relying on their upbringing that must be unlocked with levelling points.

### Designing Skills

When designing skills, never design them for a character. You can use a character inspiration as an archetype, but the skill is a tradition of hundreds or thousands of people and should be designed to fit a setting, not to provide for an individual. Consider using your own real-life knowledge and context to design a profound and thoughtful skill based around your own special knowledge and interests.  
When designing skills, keep in mind that they should open up access to the entire arena of play, so don’t design them to be so niche or singular that they narrow a character’s scope, but rather that they provide a unique perspective and set of abilities to provide that character with greater access to the world.  
Sometimes it can be difficult to squeeze a concept rigidly into a single arena of play. Perhaps the idea can be broken across two different skills that are working together to provide the broad scope you are imagining, and either of those skills could theoretically also be taken with other skills to end up with a totally new concept. A Pirate, for example could be any mix of a Brigand (Martial), a Sea Witch (Magic), a Privateer (Factions) and a Sailor (Recon), and just using these four skills, there are six possible combinations that all can be found on a pirate ship.  
You may find that exchanging one proficiency in your skill description for that of another skill description can also do a lot to diversify and resolve your skill concept. These Crossover Proficiencies should be limited to a single example in each skill, for example a Mage Hunter Martial class dipping in to a single Minor Arcanum instead of a sport to protect themselves from their preferred foe.

##### Martial

Martial traditions are centred around the body, movement, fitness, and violence. They must justify violence within a context, sometimes one that is quite arcane and confusing to outsiders, sometimes one as simple as “violence is acceptable to use against all those that the leadership declares that violence is acceptable to use against.” This rarely limits them, of course, usually the justification for violence is applied post-hoc, or consent is manufactured beforehand, both processes better left to Faction leaders.  
Martial skills consist of **Proficiencies** that include: 

* One category of tools or weapons such as swords.  
* Another way to do violence, which might include an additional category of weapons.  
* A type of movement in the tactical arena, such as climbing or squeezing.  
* A sport or area of knowledge.

Remind users that they can always add any Martial Plays as abilities by using one levelling point.

##### Magic

Magic Traditions are very diverse, and can have a profound impact on your setting in general. They should make some attempt to justify and detail the use of magic, including moral, philosophical principles behind its use, where it comes from, and why the tradition’s use of magic is particularly acceptable. Additionally, magic traditions confer one each of the following benefits:

* A way to manipulate their spells by changing one characteristic and adding 1e to the casting cost. You can either allow any characteristic to be changed for a restricted school of magic or target creature type, or you can allow any school or target type, but only one category of characteristic can be changed. **Either you can change any part of an Enchantment, or you can change only the range of any type of spell, as two examples.** In the case of Major Arcanum, you must only learn the spell in its altered form, in the case of minor arcanum, scrolls, etc, you can alter them on the fly.  
* A category of Magic tools as found in Chapter 3 such as wands/rods/staffs.  
* A Minor Arcanum as found in Chapter 3\.

Be sure to remind users that your magic tradition allows them to learn any Minor or Major Arcanum that they come across by using a levelling point.

##### Factions

Faction skills are the skills used by individuals to take advantage of faction assets and collective power. They are very strongly culturally informed, and usually suit certain regions and their factions. Taken totally out of context, the individuals retain their overall skills in diplomacy and charisma, but without the support of the social structures that they have built these skills upon. For example, the concept of observing etiquette is somewhat universal, but the particulars of dining etiquette vary greatly. Therefore a master of tea ceremonies may have a great impact across a number of different factions, but they also have a sense for reading people and inducing calm diplomacy that transcends the specifics of their training. Faction skills confer the following benefits:

* An Additional Language, dialect, slang, jargon, cant, code, sign language or artistic expression that is particular to their culture or a specific faction.  
* An Interpersonal Interaction that allows them to generate leverage with members of specific factions for free.  
* A Social Art that they can perform during long rests that allow them to take some specified free action while also benefiting from the long rest.

Include a reminder that Factions skills allow any character to take on a quest to try to add an Asset to the faction, or to use levelling points to acquire a Personal Asset for themselves.

##### Recon

Recon skills aside from the generic ones already offered in the appendix are exclusively related to Regions. They represent a profound connection to that region and the land in general, and often carry characteristics of the land as well. Recon Region Skills always include proficiency in movement, checks and saves while in the region in question, and confer two out of the following proficiencies:

* A pack and related equipment particular to the Region and the ability to convert supply to certain items without a pack.  
* A Generalized method of movement, terrain type proficiency, or creature type proficiency that applies outside the region.  
* Proficiency with a class of mount or vehicle that is emblematic of the region.

### Designing Creatures

Creatures are usually not humanoids, as humanoids are capable of complex social interactions and communication, they are usually characters instead.  
Set out the creature inspiration and purpose in the setting or adventure. Be sure to tie it in narratively to the world at large and establish its level.  
Establish its natural abilities including movement methods and speeds and its primary sense. Use official content references for similar creatures’ natural abilities.  
Creatures usually occupy two arenas of play with the creature’s natural form being its skills. Sometimes different types, species or versions might exist with different skills.  
Describe the proficiencies that the creature naturally has, including any natural weapons and resistances.  
Using double the creature’s level, distribute levelling points in the form of additional max energy and abilities from whichever arenas of play it would naturally occupy or abilities found in similar official content creatures.

### Designing Characters

Non-Player Characters are designed in the same manner that Player-characters are.  
Start with a Personality, including visual information, auditory cue, downtime activity, etc. Work through their skills, equipment, relations, or anything else that is relevant to the party. Feel free to drop in appropriate existing characters from official or table content that have not been used yet.

### Designing Factions

Factions consist of dozens or hundreds of people organized in a way that a character might be a member. They could be families, political parties, clubs, unions, guilds, secret societies, corporations, ministries, cults, or any other self-identified organization of people with any number of stated, implied, or secretive goals and rules. They have specific relationships with other factions that they commonly interact with and may also encourage or restrict access to other skills.  
Define your faction, how it acquires and controls membership, and its tier of play. A lower-tier faction will operate in a geographically smaller area, whereas a higher-tier one will occupy a geographically larger area. Social constructs like countries and nations may also create super-structures of factions that tend to not occupy territories across national borders, so a series of lower-tier and mid-tier factions may occupy two distinct zones that represent two different countries. Your library card doesn’t work in another country.  
Define your faction’s history, relationships with other important factions, and what its operative locales look and feel like. Add a market, and a few characters and locales just in case it gets explored in detail.

### Designing Markets

Designing markets is very straightforward, but also very tedious, and is actually the design element that is probably most advanced and requires the most judgement and finesse.   
You should simply take an existing market document, this could be a magazine, catalogue, historical research paper, historical pricing decree, list of things you find in a thrift store, etc. and figure out the typical, day’s wages within the context of that market. Now this idea of “typical day’s wages” is a very arcane concept that even academics struggle with, so just make a reasonable guess using the average, median, or some stated wage in context. The fact that you will be off is actually fine because it will alter the price point for your whole market, which is good. Next, using the average day’s wage as a GP indicator, convert all the prices to GP, rounding to the nearest 1/10.  
Lastly, for items that should include stats, caveats, restrictions, etc, include them in the descriptions of those items. This likely includes conveying magical properties to real world or historical items that do not have magical properties, so your judgement and discretion makes a huge difference.

### Designing Locales

Locales are unique places with special characteristics. The key feature of locales is that they are limited to spaces that are less than 300m, and are therefore tactical spaces that can be traversed in less than a minute and shot across with a bow or gun.  
First, figure out what the reason for establishing the locale is, and be sure it serves that purpose. It should be well suited to its region, or a few regions, and may be linked to a faction or creature as well.  
Next, you might decide that the locale has a special feature of some variety. It might be a type of terrain or obstacle that is typical of the locale, or a buff that it gives to certain skills. You can tie in markets, characters, and many other components of the locale to integrate it into the setting and ensure that it feels like it has a purpose beyond whatever the party needs from it at any given time and design a map, street view, or other art to help deliver the sense of the locale.

### Designing Regions

Regions are vast areas, hundreds or even thousands of kilometers to a side that present a contiguous, though not uniform geography. They are not general geographies like “mountains”, they are specific, even within an area that is otherwise similar geographically. For example, the Antarctic is not a good basis for a region. Instead, dozens of regions can be pulled out of its extremely varied geography from ice shelves to coastlines to mountains, to lakes shrouded in darkness beneath glaciers.   
Once you have sized your region appropriately and decided on the overall terrain type, include a short list of possible creatures, locales and factions that operate in the region and the corresponding Recon skill for the region. Define the major settlements and the roads between them to allow for calculations on travel. Make sure to at least consider the neighboring regions, and their influence in each sphere, including economy, ecology, facftions, etc, as well as the regional ties to the Unseen Worlds.

# Glossary {#glossary}

**Ability \[Play|Spell|Asset|Strategy\]**  
Abilities are discrete actions a creature can perform, sometimes with an associated energy, supply or social credit cost that have a mechanical effect.  
Natural Abilities are abilities that are granted by virtue of a creature's basic nature and physical characteristics.  
Background Abilities are abilities that are granted by virtue of a character’s background.  
Each Arena of Play uses a particular word to describe its abilities, however they are functionally identical within the idicyncracies of their arena of play. Plays are Martial Abilities, Spells are Magic Abilities, Assets are Faction Abilities and Strategies are Recon Abilities.

**Arena of Play**  
A mode of understanding actions in a mechanical context as being either martial, magical, faction or recon based.

**Breakthrough**  
A result that is more than 5 points above the difficulty, indicating an unqualified success or major shift in outcomes as dictated by the narrative.

**Buff \[Debuff\]**  
Take the higher of the two dice rolled. You can do this by expending energy for physical and magical actions, social credit for faction actions, and various other methods found elsewhere. Having multiple reasons to be buffed has no effect.  
Debuff is to prevent the higher die from being taken. Debuffs always overcome any number of buffs, so if there are 3 reasons a creature is buffed and only one reason it is debuffed, it takes the lower die.

**Challenge \[Fate Challenge\]**

A challenge is a series of checks set out to accomplish a narrative goal that has both a success and fail state, and uncertainty of either.

A fate challenge, usually the culmination of a series of other challenges, is a challenge that a player would like to use to challenge their character’s fate. The success state is tied to the character levelling up, and the fail state indicates that the character is permanently retired or dies.

**Character**  
A Character is a Humanoid with a Personality.

**Check \[Skill Check | Save\]**  
A check is a roll to test the consequences of an action. If the result of failure would impose a condition on the one executing the action, it is called a save.

**Conditions \[Minor and Critical\]**  
Conditions are afflictions that alter how a character can access their abilities, skills, proficiencies, buffs and other features.  
Minor conditions can reduce access to or effectiveness of some skills and abilities. Critical conditions reduce the character to a barely playable state.  
Unless otherwise stated, conditions can be relieved over the course of a long rest.Temporary conditions end at the end of a challenge. Permanent conditions cannot be overcome in a long rest and require a narrative solution (quest).

**Consequence**  
The narrative effect that takes place because of a check or save, which often has a mechanical component as well.

**Creature**  
A creature is an object, composite or swarm with an intrinsic ability to act upon the world.

**Damage**  
The number result of a check or save where the consequence is the application of a condition.

**Difficulty \[Base\]**  
The defense number for a check against an inanimate object, geography, etc. The difficulty operates identically to the passive defense of a creature in that a check is compared against it to determine a consequence of an action.  
Base Difficulty of a region, faction or locale is the assumed difficulty to take any unsure action regarding that geography or polity, for example to cross a river or find a market.  
The GM never arbitrates difficulties, they are based on the base difficulty, a stated creature’s passive skills, or on the party level \+5.

**Encounter**  
The meeting of two or more parties in a locale where they can sense eachother and interact meaningfully. Often intentionally contrived narratively or through an initiative check.

**Energy \[Max\]**  
The stored biochemical energy you can exert to undertake exceptional actions, including buffing actions, casting spells and using martial plays.  
A human’s max energy starts at 2 and can be increased by 1 by using a levelling point, representing increased overall fitness and efficiency at their usual actions.

**Ethereal**   
Anything without substantive physical form, such as smoke, mist, or arcane ether. Ethereal things have a location in the physical world, but they can share their space with any number of other ethereal things or any number of physical things that also fit in that space. They can move through most materials except iron, lead and certain other materials you designate for your setting, though most materials would be considered difficult terrain. Only those materials they cannot cross can be used to physically harm ethereal creatures or objects. Ethereal things are not necessarily invisible, nor are they necessarily visible. Their default visibility depends on the nature of their etherealness. Ethereal creatures cannot be tracked using terrain type, since they do not interact with terrain very much. They can still be tracked using their creature type or locality. Ethereal creatures cannot interact with physical objects, including iron or lead.

**Graduated Check**  
The repetition of a nearly identical check, which therefore takes place over the next higher time scale. For example, a check to open a door as an action can be re-taken using identical methods, characters and tools, but it will then be taken as a minute-long check. It could again be re-taken but as a ten-minute long check, etc.

**Humanoid**  
A Creature that is capable of communicating and understanding communication, forming and understanding complex social bonds, and therefore acting in and being subject to the factions arena of play. The exact definition can be elusive, but you could consider whether or not a creature would be reasonably capable of articulating the Prisoners’ Dilemma as a benchmark. Not all creatures that can communicate are humanoids. It does not refer to their silhouette or physical characteristics in any way.

**Locale**  
An area, usually less than 300m to a side, that represents a discrete tactical unit. It cannot easily be entered or exited or circumvented, has defined edges and an identity such as “the bowling alley” or “around the pond”. It can therefore be targeted by checks such as initiative, investigations and some spells, and it is the unit by which initiative usually sets up and tactical challenges are undertaken.

**Points \[Intel | Initiative\]**  
The numeric result of an intel or initiative check, usually used to establish the number of data points or preparatory actions available as a consequence of each check respectively.

**Proficiency \[Bonus\]**  
The knowledge of how to do something and practice of being able to do it, expressed mechanically by adding your proficiency bonus (equal to your level) to a roll to come out with a result.

**Rest \[Short|Long\]**  
A period in which a character engages in physical and mental recovery, often reclining, relaxing, eating, sleeping, socializing and engaging in their downtime activity. In order to rest, a creature must be in an environment that they can naturally survive indefinitely, including an appropriate temperature and moisture, the ability to change positions, etc.  
A short rest takes one hour and consumes one ration, and allows the creature to recover energy up to half its maximum energy, so if its maximum is 6, it can only regain energy to come up to 3\.  
A long rest takes 8 hours, and requires the creature to consume one ration and have access to water for washing and drinking, and for the creature to fall asleep. At the end of a long rest, a creature restores all its energy and social credit, and can either eliminate a minor condition or reduce a critical condition to its minor form.

**Result**  
The Result of a check or roll is the numerical value of the chosen die plus proficiency. For example, if you roll 2 and 7 and have a proficiency of \+6, your result is 8 unless you buff the roll, in which case it is 15\.

**Roll**  
The numbers that appear on the dice when they are rolled such as 8-11 or 2-7.

**Sense \[Primary\]**  
The ability that a creature uses to perceive the world. All creatures have a primary sense, which is specifically defined if it is not equivalent to human vision. The primary use of a sense is to designate targets, so a creature must be obscured from its opponents primary sense to avoid being targeted. A creature can use non-primary senses to try to designate targets, but does so within the limits of that sense and without proficiency.

**Social Credit \[Max\]**  
Some combination of your charisma, wealth, family background, fame, and the myriad other things that guide peoples’ perception of you and your ability to get people to do what you want.  
Humans start with 1 max social credit and can add additional social credit by using  levelling points, representing their increased fame, wealth, knowledge, or skill in social circles.

**Supply**  
Stuff you have. It remains undefined until such a time as you need to use it for something, at which time it takes on a form that is narratively plausible based on your surroundings, character, skills, packs or other narrative reasoning.

**Target**  
Many abilities, especially spells, require you to target a creature, object or location. You must be able to sense targets using your creature’s natural primary sense. For most characters this means you must be able to see them. Creatures that are hidden are presumed to be hidden from this sense, no matter what it is, meaning they cannot be targeted.  
Humans’ primary sense is sight, but we also have considerable spatial sense. For that reason, humans can target such creatures as “the creature beneath the blanket” or “the figure in the dark,” even if their exact nature is obscured, we can see enough of them to put their body together spatially. In total darkness, humans cannot target creatures even if they can feel or hear them. As long as you can use your primary sense to sense them, you can target them. This means humans can target through mirrors or remote viewing. Other creatures such as dogs would use their own primary sense, smell, to the same effect. If you are aware of the primary sense of a creature, you can make an ordinary encounter check to hide from their primary sense and prevent them from targeting you.

**Time \[Tactical | Strategic\]**  
Tactical time takes place in discrete rounds, with each opposing side taking one turn each round to undertake their tactical maneuvers and actions. Overall, tactical challenges usually take less than one minute, with each round representing a few seconds. Tactical challenges usually address tactically relevant uncertainties, for example rushing to get onto a train that is currently departing. Generally, martial actions are tactical (take a few seconds) unless otherwise stated or narratively obvious.  
Strategic time takes longer. The intervals are one hour, in which time all parties simultaneously conduct their strategic actions. If there is an uncertainty when it comes to which such actions take place first, the answer is usually resolved tactically. For example, if two parties are trying to get to a nearby town, a tactical challenge to board the train may determine which party arrives minutes before the other. Generally, Faction and Recon checks are strategic (take one hour) unless otherwise stated or narratively obvious.

## Work in Progress

This is a work in progress and is being updated.


## Why this project and who am I?

G'day, I'm known as Coweater and I'm the lead designer for an indie RPG [7th Extinction](https:7thExtinctionrpg.com). I needed something simple to create and host my SRD and after searching the web and a lot of trial & error I settled on Docsify, thanks Gulluth for your previous work. Knowing that not everyone is technically minded I wanted to do more than point indie developers to Docsify and say 'use this'.

So the plan is to continue to tweak and develop this, ensuring to keep it a simple project that any indie rpg can use to create great looking SRD online with zero cost and little technical knowledge.
