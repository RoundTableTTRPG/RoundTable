# Chapter 7 : Advanced Rules and Appendices

With the basics out of the way, feel free to play around to get the hang of them. Explain an action to your more experience players, they’ll tell you the difficulty to beat, then roll an outcome and see if it works. Now moving on to the next stage, we can examine rules about specific situations.

## Health and Conditions

There are no health points of any kind in Round Table. Creatures in Round Table are subject to conditions that alter how they are able to act, which have a minor and critical form, and can be temporary, ordinary, or permanent. Damage is calculated only to select either a minor or critical condition as appropriate, with 1-4 damage inflicting a minor condition and 5+ inflicting a critical condition.  
The only impacts of damage or harm should be specific conditions, which give your table flexibility to impose debuffs on certain checks, etc. No wounds system or generalized debuffs should be used.  
Minor conditions reduce the number of actions you can take, or your effectiveness at those actions, whereas Critical Conditions greatly reduce your actions, usually to only a select few.  
When a creature takes 1-4 damage, they will be subject to a minor condition related to the source of the damage. Sometimes the source will detail conditions, sometimes the conditions will follow logically from the fiction. For example, it can be assumed that a bear trap should cause the immobilized condition.  
If a creature takes 5 or more damage, the critical form of the condition in question is imposed rather than the minor form. In the example of the bear trap, failing a save so drastically causes the victim to faint due to shock and become unconscious. You can also stuffer a critical condition if you would receive a minor condition, but are already subject to the identical minor condition, for example, if you would be dazzled but are already dazzled, you would be blinded instead.

Critical conditions generally remove creatures from play. If the creatures are enemy minions, you can generally discard them without worrying too much about the details of their conditions. The GM or other players might track critical conditions in key opponents or allies if needed.  
If a player’s character receives a Critical Condition, on the other hand, the Critical Condition must be resolved when the party has a chance to rest and compose themselves. A Critical Condition resolves itself after a long rest, turning to its minor form, unless there is a narrative reason that it might resolve into a permanent injury or death.

A **Permanent Injury** imposes a minor or critical condition on a creature that cannot be resolved until the party completes some other task, essentially standing in the way of their progress until they complete a side-bar. In the example of the bear trap, it could lead to an amputation, imposing the immobilized condition on the victim until the party finds some way to restore them. Generally speaking, it’s up to the players, along with the GM, to agree on a permanent injury as well as its solution. If the players want to play a very gritty game, they may impose permanent injuries as the norm.

**Death** occurs when a character is pursuing their Fate, and receives a critical condition as part of that pursuit. The choice to die is ultimately up to the player as a way to resolve their critical injury.

**Temporary Injuries** are removed automatically at the end of a tactical encounter or minute, or if the condition of the injury is removed, for example a bear trap may only immobilize an opponent as long as it is attached to them and can simply be removed.

#### **Physical Conditions**

| :---- | :---- |
| Malcomposed You lose proficiency in your natural abilities as parts of your body decompose into strange forms. | Transmogrified You lose your natural abilities (possibly gaining others with which you do not have proficiency) as your limbs and organs are replaced with… others. |

#### **Exhaustion**

When you are forced to expend energy beyond your lower limit of 0, the remainder is taken as damage, imposing a related condition.. For example, if you are given a sleeping potion that consumes 10 energy, and you only had 2 left, you would suffer 8 damage from the potion, giving you a critical injury, most likely *unconscious*..

#### **Suffocation and Drowning**

Usually, these effects are the result of a tactical challenge such as escaping a sinking ship or swimming across a dangerous river or identifying noxious air. Failure leads to your character drowning or suffocating, the outcome being that they are incapacitated.

#### **Possession**

If a creature is possessed, conditions should be specified to affect the body, the host, or the possessor. All three are considered to occupy the same space, and only a creature with a primary sense capable of sorting them out can choose which to hit with a spell or other attack, otherwise they can only target the element that is most obvious to their primary sense, for example the body for creatures relying on sight. The host and the possessor can simultaneously try to control the body, but more often one overcomes the other and subjects them to a condition that renders them incapable of controlling the body such as incapacitated. If the body is rendered incapable of moving or acting, so too are both the host and possessor.

### Resting And Healing

#### **Healing**

Healing is expressed as the removal of conditions. The simplest form is when temporary conditions end because the events that concern the temporary condition end. For example, if a creature is afflicted with *afraid* temporarily, and the object of their fear is destroyed, they are no longer *afraid.* Temporary conditions also end automatically after the tactical event or one minute.  
Various abilities, spells and equipment might present other ways to resolve conditions instantly or in short order, or concurrently with natural healing, allowing for multiple conditions to be removed at once. Otherwise, natural healing is detailed in the following section on resting.

**Resting**  
A short rest takes one hour and requires the creature resting to be able to move its body if it is able and to eat. Any effects that require a short rest come into effect once the hour is over, and most creatures can remove one minor condition over the course of their short rest. They also bring their current energy level up to half of their maximum if it had fallen below that.  
A long rest requires 8 hours and for the creature to both eat and sleep, as well as sufficient water for cleaning and drinking. At the end of the long rest, energy and social credit are restored up to the maximum and a single minor condition can be removed or a critical condition can be reduced to its minor form.

## Death, Fate and Levelling Up

In order to level up, your character must challenge their fate successfully. Challenging your fate is how your ordinary character can rise above, so it represents both an opportunity and an obstacle. For example, if you are fated to die in a snowstorm, you are also fated to level up by surviving a snowstorm. Once all the characters in your party are designed, you will work together to design your fates. Not every character or player needs to be challenging their fate at all times. In fact, it should be a relatively uncommon occurrence.

### The Fate Challenge

At some point in your adventure, you and your GM should detail the particulars of your next fate challenge, for example clarifying with them that you would like a particular event such as defeating a particular opponent to be your characters fate challenge. The GM will design a series of challenges that will statistically lead to your party failing the fate challenge by consuming your party’s energy and presenting difficulty ratings with a less than 50% chance of success. Without clever strategizing and planning, your character is likely to fail the fate challenge, so it’s up to you to figure out how to succeed.

### Levelling up

If you do manage to succeed at levelling up, you earn two levelling points. You can always use them to add 1 to your max Energy or Social Credit, or to learn a new ability in one of your two arenas of play. There are many other uses for levelling points, but your character must generally come across a specific opportunity to spend them (such as uncovering a unique Major Arcana), and then level up to take advantage of that opportunity.

## Economics

### GP

While it is assumed that regions, factions, and even locales might have a particular form of currency, these different currencies are largely used in a practical sense to guide and restrict markets. You can usually only pay fines in the local currency, for example. Thus as a feature of market restriction rather than of wealth tabulation, currencies are integrated into the Round Table system of market tables and faction assets. To quickly and easily summarize the amount of wealth you can access, GP is used, which theoretically amounts to a day’s labour. In different cultures, different values of your daily wages may be accessible in different ways and different times, from grams of salt to digital wallets containing only debt, people are weird about how they imagine money, but we just use GP to roughly estimate the amount of stuff you can access at any given time. Just like a fancy L stands for pounds sterling, which is not pounds of silver but a complex digital fiat currency, GP stands for a days’ labour value.

### Treasure

Things that are not comparable to GP; unique quest items, are referred to as treasure. They cannot be bought, or they can only be bought with an amount of money that indicates that the exchange of actual cash is irrelevant to both parties. Nuclear weapons and Major Arcanum are examples of things over which money sometimes trades hands, but also things where the exchange of money is not really the key aspect of acquiring the treasure. If you would like to acquire treasure, come up with an adventure to do so.

### Inventory

Your inventory consists of the things that are being carried or stored by your party on your persons, minions, mounts, containers, and vehicles.

#### Inventory Slots

It is assumed your character has a number of “inventory slots”. For a standard human, you can think of your back, your body and each arm as a “slot”.  
Your back is a medium slot, whereas your body and each arm are small slots. You also carry insignificant items such as individual coins, rings, ammunition, the clothes you are wearing, etc. on your body. Clearly, if you are meant to be carrying inventory in your hands you cannot use them to do other tasks unless you put the items down. Similarly, your GM may prevent you from moving in certain ways such as squeezing if you have a backpack on or jumping if you are fully loaded out.  
There is not a specific number value of mass that restricts how your character is loaded out. Some people can carry a lot, some people can’t. The more serious restriction among people is not usually how much they can carry, but how much they are willing to carry, so it’s important to have a good vision in your mind of your character’s physical abilities and also their personality.  
A simple guide to follow is design intent. If your character would pick something up with one hand, it’s considered small. Items specifically made to be lifted in one arm are therefore considered small. Likewise, if you would use two arms to pick it up, or it is designed to be picked up by two handles or put on your back (for example, it has two arm straps like a backpack), it’s medium. Similarly, collections of items can be categorized this way as well. A soup can is small. A 12-pack is small. Some people would consider a 24-pack of cans to be small, some would lift it with both arms and consider it medium. Large items are those designed to be moved by two people or a pack animal. A human is probably capable of moving a large item without too much difficulty in the tactical environment, but you can’t travel while holding it in your hands.

#### Inventory Call

At the beginning of an adventure or long distance travel, sometimes at the beginning of an encounter, especially one involving theft or ambush, your GM may make an inventory call. When this happens, you simply have to tabulate how your character is loaded out. Go through their inventory and break things up into groups, figure out how your character is meant to be carrying them.  
You don’t have to track your inventory in this level of detail all the time. If the GM makes an inventory call and you realize your character’s inventory is unrealistic and they should have been overburdened for the past few hours of play, you can just move on, you don’t have to rectify past play. It’s at the inventory call that your character has finally been overcome with their burden and can’t carry on in this way any more or realizes they have forgotten something. You can also make minor adjustments in consultation with your table, for example exchanging some of your GP for a pack animal or cart when you realize you’re overburdened at the inventory call. It’s best to do an inventory call in a situation in which these exchanges make sense, for example while the party is passing through a market village. If nothing else, you can have your character try to fashion some sort of improvised sledge to try to drag a large inventory slot along with them.  
On the other hand, if you love logistics and hex-crawl style play, you can inventory call yourself all the time, and constantly know exactly how your character is carrying everything. You can also take over this role for the rest of the party if they agree to that, and tabulate how everyone is carrying everything. This role is meant to be a relief, not a burden. Don’t call out other players for their inventory, just suggest how to rectify it.

### Encumbrance and Burdens

You are capable of carrying more than you should. If you have maxed out every inventory slot on yourself or any other creature or cart, your loadout is burdensome. This imposes a debuff on all rolls while a creature is so encumbered. You are only encumbered as long as you carry the items, so if you could conceivably just put the items down while you do the task you are not encumbered. You should not carry so much inventory that all your slots are full, or carry more than half your weight.  
If it is unclear whether or not a given creature is capable of lifting or moving an object, the GM will have them make a graduating roll against the burden. The graduating roll indicates how long you can lift or carry the object for, starting with a roll to lift it and put it back down, then graduating to one round, one minute, and so on. A good rule of thumb is that this roll is required for any creature to lift more than its own weight, but certain strange creatures such as ants and jellies are more or less capable of carrying their own weight.

## Geography

### Regions

Regions are distinct geographical areas characterized by shared human and physical geography. They serve as the foundation for world-building in Round Table, providing the context for adventures, encounters, and character interactions. Each region possesses unique characteristics that influence gameplay.  
A region’s **Name** reflects its defining cultural and physical characteristics.  
The **Terrain Type**, sometimes consisting of a pair of terrain types, defines the default terrain type that will be encountered whenever a creature travels in the region. It strongly influences the terrain type of locales, however locales are frequently little areas of a different terrain type within a region, which is what makes them notable.  
The **Base Difficulty** represents the overall difficulty level of navigating the region's terrain and social landscape. This value is used as a baseline for determining the difficulty of various checks and challenges within the region, and either represents how inhospitable and remote it is, or how coveted it is by factions.  
Regions contain any number of **Locales**, which are smaller tactical units that may represent an ordinary, stereotypical place in the Region, a unique spot, or a faction’s typical built environment that just so happens to be in the region. Each locale in a region is rarely defined, players are usually free to establish the existence of locales in a region as needed.  
**Recon Skills** providing specialization in a region have unique quirks and abilities that are defined in the region’s brief. They do not restrict those recon characters from operating outside the region, and often give them unique skills that are broadly applicable to other situations.  
Regions are deeply connected to a setting, with their own history and lore that covers all arenas of play, the overall world setting, different creature types, and many other considerations. Even when they are drawn directly from the infinitely diverse and awe-inspiring regions of the real world, they offer a unique in-game experience. Rather than generalized biomes like the ocean, or a forest, regions should emerge from a concept of truly unique places. As an example, when imagining and establishing a vast desert, do not stop with “the big desert” as a region. Instead, you can imagine several regions such as “the Lake of Dunes”, then “the Qattara Depression” then “Siwa Oaisis,” then “Red Dune Sea”, then “The Black Rocks,” then “the Great Wadi of Air”. These diverse regions each have their challenges and local lore, even though together they represent an 800km journey through what feels like an endless desert, and in fact they are all desert terrain type regions.

### Locales

Locales are specific locations within a Region that serve as settings for individual scenes and encounters. They represent the granular level of the game world, where players interact directly with the environment, NPCs, and challenges.  
Locales usually, but don’t always inherit the region’s **base difficulty**. If they have another difficulty rating, you should establish why that is. For example, a stronghold’s factions systematically build and guard it to increase its difficulty rating on purpose, whereas a village might represent an easier place to live in an otherwise rugged region.  
Locales are restricted in area, and can be butted up against eachother or even overlap. For example, an arena represents a complete play space, so could be one locale, while a small market street might represent another, even though the entrance to the arena is on that market street. The question is whether or not tactical actions can be shared through the space. The arena’s entry and exits are monitored, so passing between the arena and the market street takes some intention. This is why even if a spell effect, weapon, or anything else could theoretically reach into a neighboring locale, effects need to be tagged as strategic in nature to cross a locale’s boundaries. This applies to movement, communication, spell and equipment effects, faction operations etc.  
When establishing locales, avoid simply dictating that the things you need are in the locale. Be sure to establish why that locale should exist in the region, its impact on factions and creatures, its history, etc. Establishing these things can help other players by inspiring them to jump off your ideas, or reminding them of their own needs that might also be found in the locale, or help your table create engaging settings and conflicts that fit into your world.

### Travel

When travelling, the first thing you should do is an inventory call, so you can ensure that you can carry everything you need. You next define your destination and how you can get there. Creatures, mounts and vehicles have strategic movement speeds, whereas platforms typically operate with an itinerary. You establish how long the travel will take, and how many resources must be used to complete it, adding in rests if you want. Usually, you will break travel down into consistent units, so if you are meant to walk, then drive, then sail, you will be considered to be travelling three separate times. Sometimes you are interrupted in the middle of your travel and have to engage in a new mode, so you must start your travel considerations over.  
Once you have figured out what it will take to complete the travel, you can either consider it transactional: pass the time and resources necessary and be done with it, or your GM may design an adventure around it.

### Mounts, Vehicles and Platforms

Mounts are subject to the movements of their riders. Whether they are creatures or not, they are small enough that the movement and positioning of their riders is important to their own movement. For this reason, the rider and mount must both maneuver to the same goal, ie take the same maneuver, in order for them to both achieve that goal. Both rider and mount are subject to any saves or checks to clear terrain or take risky maneuvers, and it is possible for one or the other or both or neither to fail, and the result of that failure is visited upon whichever one of them failed.  
Vehicles, whether creatures or not, can withstand their occupants moving independently of them, however have limited space for those occupants to move, usually in the form of seats or cargo spaces. Vehicles might include a riding elephant, automobile, carriage, or raft. Movement on, over, or inside a vehicle is always squeezing and often risky, and there are a few specified positions that creatures can occupy.  
Platforms are very large objects or creatures that represent unique terrain that is able to move relative to the geography. Tactical events like skirmishes often take place on platforms, with the platforms’ interactions with the terrain and surrounding locale more often interpreted as a separate event. Creatures may or may not be proficient in types of movement that are characteristic of certain platforms, such as the jostling, shifting terrain of air and sea vessels, or the particular squeezing points of trains and aircraft.

### Platform Combat

Platform challenges are challenges that take place between vehicles, platforms, and sometimes terrain or structures. For example, racing cars, using a helicopter to rappel into a cavern, or taking boarding actions from one boat to another would be considered Platform challenges.  
Vehicles and platforms have statistics just like creatures. In fact, some vehicles and platforms are creatures. Both motorcycles and horses are mounts, both elephants and cars are vehicles, both huge dragons and helicopters are platforms. Platforms and vehicles have components like creatures have limbs, so you can target them to impose specific conditions such as immobilized, or to knock out a specific capacity such as a mounted weapon, however platforms can generally not be targeted by light weapons like bows and guns, they must be targeted by heavy weaponry, like-platform mounted machine guns or rockets.  
Boarding from one platform to another, or otherwise maneuvering off your platform or onto another is generally treated as a regular maneuver. If you are removed from platforms, structures, vehicles, and have no way to impact the platform challenge (you have no heavy weapons and can’t reasonably reach a platform), you are effectively incapacitated from the challenge.  
Maneuvering on platforms can usually be achieved by the move around maneuver, but such movement can be hampered by the very restrictive structure of the platform and the presence of many opponents in a tiny area. In effect, you can usually consider any change of position while on a platform, especially a hostile one, to be considered both risky movement and squeezing.
