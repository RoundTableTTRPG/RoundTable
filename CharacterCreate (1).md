## The Section Detailing the Basic Overview of Your Character

Your character is defined by three interconnected parts: their personality, their background, and their skills. None of these parts can be created in a vacuum, so it is impossible to generate a character without a context; both their party and the wider world.

### Personality

Your character’s personality includes the key features that identify and define them and are informed by the setting and your character’s background.

**Names** are key identifiers that also give us a place in society. Names are almost always given by others, and most cultures have important naming conventions that help situate you in your social groups.

**Physical Appearance** includes both anatomical data such as hair colour and cultural expressions such as hair style, both of which are often equally important.

**Auditory Cues** are used to facilitate role-play, make your character more memorable, and develop their upbringing and attitudes.

**Link to the Party** is a feature of all characters, including Player-Characters. It can include relationships, genealogy, social groupings, or simply commonalities that make you click with the party.

**Downtime Activities** help fill out your character and connect them to their skills, background and wider world. It’s also what you’re doing when you are caught unawares.

**Fate** is simultaneously how your character will exit the game, and also how they will level-up. How many times can you challenge your fate before it refuses to bend? Fate is usually presented as a mortal statement such as “I will die in a boxing match.”

### Background

Extensive, unique backgrounds are offered as setting-specific additions to published modules. They include suggestions on personality traits common to the background such as naming conventions of a certain society. They also include unique abilities granted only to those with the background, and access to additional abilities that can be learned or honed over your adventuring career regardless of their arena of play. These background abilities can, for example, give a fighter access to a spell or magical ability, or give a ranger access to an artistic talent or additional language. A starting background is found in the Appendix.

### Skills

Your character has 2 skills, which are deep, unique sets of proficiencies, abilities and context that drive the mechanics, personality and development of your character. Each skill belongs to one of the 4 Arenas of Play; martial, magic, factions or recon. You can choose two skills from the same arena. The skills themselves include starting proficiencies and abilities that are wide-ranging. There can be no exhaustive list of either skills or proficiencies, and overlaps and gaps are common. Skills often feature unique abilities found nowhere else in the game, but also make recommendations about more generic abilities within their arena of play. A selection of starting skills are found in the Appendix.

### Other Attributes

**Proficiencies** are defined by your background and skills. They are the things to which you can apply your proficiency bonus, and they are not bound by exhaustive lists or limitations on their definitions. You can be proficient in the use of all knives, or in understanding bird communications, or in navigating through forest terrain, or in navigating as long as you can see the moon. Each proficiency is a rule unto itself.  
**Bonuses**, whether skill, save, or proficiency are simply equal to your level. If you are level 4, your bonus is always \+4.  
**Passive Skill** is the ability you have to take on an action you are proficient with when you are not actively doing so, for example to walk over ice while you are actively scanning the horizon for danger, or to be aware of danger while you actively plod your way across the ice. It is always 5 \+ your proficiency bonus.  
**Energy** is used to buff your roll (take the higher dice), or to activate abilities. Because it’s used to buff your rolls and because you roll saves and active defenses, having no energy leaves you defenseless and more likely to suffer harm. When your energy is 0, you should flee. You can regenerate to half your energy by resting for an hour or completely regenerate it by resting for 8 hours.  
**Social Credit** is used like energy for faction interactions, buffing rolls and activating abilities.  
**Leveling Points** represent the limits on what your fate opens up to your character when they successfully challenge it. You get 2 when you level up (in addition to adding \+1 to your bonuses). You can use one levelling point to add a new ability from your background or skills, or to add a new proficiency, or to increase your max energy or max Social Credit by 1\.

## The Appendix of Generic Skills

### Generic Background: The Outsider

While most backgrounds are intrinsically linked to the setting and therefore cannot be generic, the Outsider represents someone who lives as an outsider individually, not as an out-group or from another place. They are local but for whatever reason they are aloof and somewhat clueless to the society that surrounds them. This could be the result of their own intrinsic qualities such as a hermetic disposition, or it could be the result of social pressure pushing them out, perhaps because of a feature or disability. First, decide why your character is an Outsider, then align their other attributes with the regular society that your table establishes, keeping the unique attribute that pairs with their other-ness.

#### You likely have an ordinary **name** for your society, but are known by your reclusiveness, for example “Bunker Tom”. If shunned by society, you might be known primarily for the reason you are shunned.

You may have a distinctive **physical appearance** that may be tied to your reclusiveness, such as a prominent birthmark that you hide with a mask.  
People may recognize something unique in your **auditory cue** as you use outdated slang, or no slang at all, and possibly mispronounce words you have only ever read, talk to yourself, or use the wrong volume when speaking.  
**Independent Mind**  
Your years of solitude may not prepare you well for some social situations, but they also mean you instinctively come to your own conclusions rather than relying on others and ask questions that are often avoided. 

* You gain \+1 intel point whenever you hit with an investigation of a faction.

**Abilities**  
You can acquire the following abilities regardless of your arenas of play, adding your proficiency bonus to them. You do not automatically get all these abilities, but can take them as you level up by spending 1 levelling point each if you choose  
.

* **Quiet Presence** You are proficient in maneuvering without being seen.  
* **Legend Lore** You gain the Major Arcanum Legend.  
* **Magic Shy** You gain the Arcane Veil Minor Arcanum.  
* **Secret Place** You can establish a safehouse as a personal asset.  
* **Without A Trace** You are proficient in recon checks to hide.

### Generic Martial Skill: The Brawler

A brawler is an informally trained martial artist focusing on hand-to-hand and practical combat skills. They are often focused on their own safety and security, with a philosophy that projecting violence can keep you from being victimized by it.  
You are proficient with everyday weapons that don’t carry social stigmas or restrictions, usually hunting implements and self defense weapons.  
You are also proficient when engaging in wresting or hand-to-hand combat.  
You are proficient in tactical maneuvers that allow you to execute a violent action on the same turn.  
You are proficient in brawling; brutal fist-fighting and wrestling sport matches that are won by the first to inflict a minor condition.

### Generic Magic Skills: The Scholar

Each school of magic has devotees. Whether it is a family or cultural fascination or reputation with a specific school, a personal interest, or simply a lack of options, people commonly develop a lopsided view of the magical arts in favour of their particular school. The Scholar is someone who studies a particular school of magic that you choose.  
Whenever you learn a Major Arcanum from your specialist school, you can choose to add 1e to its energy requirement and modify any 1 characteristic by 1 step, for example adding a target or reducing the casting time from one minute to one action.

You can use the Auxiliary Minor Arcanum, expending 1e to add yourself as the target of a friendly spell.

### Generic Faction Skill: The Diplomat

Wherever there are two factions, or even one faction and non-members, there must be people to go between them and help with communication and trade. Diplomats are naturally empathetic and charismatic, but also somewhat aloof and independent.  
You can be considered to be a member in good standing of any number of factions, even if they are hostile to eachother. Your relation with any faction member starts off as whatever is plausible and most favourable, rather than most likely.  
When you are carrying a message or directive from anyone else, you can use that as leverage so long as you are acting directly in scope of delivering that message or directive.  
When undertaking a long rest, you become aware of all the factions that openly operate in your locale.

### Recon Generic Skills

While the specific skills of the other 3 arenas of play are particular to your setting, the recon skills that rely on expertise in the terrain or creature types are universal to all settings. There is an additional class of Recon skills that represent expertise in a specific region, which of course must be unique to a setting, and therefore will be released in official content.
